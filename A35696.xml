         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Supream Magiſtrates (Defenders of the Faith)</hi> themſelves; Darts many times, being as equally fatal by a glance, as if darted in a direct line: my comfort is, that <hi>Truth</hi> is alwayes pleaſing unto God, and in ſome ſence is the <hi>Eternal Word of God,</hi> and ought ſo to be acknowledged by every individual, and falſhood and <hi>untruths</hi> diſpleaſing unto Him, and unto all good and pious Men, and no Man can receive injury from the <hi>Truth,</hi> that doth not ground himſelf upon falſhoods, <hi>Truth</hi> being always one and the ſame thing, and <hi>falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> infinite. <hi>Truths</hi> ought to be ſubmitted unto, not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint only, but out of willingneſs and love to embrace them, not only for the Evidence, but for the Author and goodneſs of them; and it is our duty willingly to reſign our judgments to be captivated unto all kinds of ſaving <hi>Truths,</hi> even to the extirpating of thoſe preſumptions, prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and principles of corruption, which uſe to ſmother and cloud and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Divine <hi>Truths.</hi> And to calumniate, puniſh, or diſcountenance defenders of Divine <hi>Truths</hi> ſeaſonably ſpoken, doth not become, nor is it wont to be done by any pious, juſt, or prudent Majeſtrates, but the contrary; and it is no Goſpel Principle for any Man, how great and how Eccleſiastick ſoever, to ſtir up envy againſt another but upon ſure and true grounds. <hi>Zorobabel</hi> obtained honour and favour of <hi>King Darius</hi> and all his <hi>Nobles</hi> above his <hi>Competitors</hi> for wiſdom, for that he preferred and declared <hi>Truth</hi> to bear away the Victory above all things, <hi>3 Eſdras 3.12.</hi> All the Earth calleth upon <hi>Truth,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſſeth it, all Works ſhake and tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteous thing. Wine, Women, Kings are wicked, and ſuch are all their wicked works, and there is no <hi>Truth</hi> in them, and they ſhall periſh in their unrighteouſneſs. <hi>Truth</hi> endureth and is always ſtrong, it liveth and conquereth for ever, with her there is no accepting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or rewards, but ſhe doth the things that are juſt, and refraineth from all unjuſt and wicked things, and all Men do well like of her Works, neither in her judgment is there any unrighteouſneſs, and ſhe is the Strength, Kingdom, Power and Majeſty of all Ages. Bleſſed be the God of <hi>Truth.</hi> At which <hi>Declaration,</hi> all the People ſhouted and ſaid, great is <hi>Truth,</hi> and mighty above all things. It is alſo alike impoſſible to pleaſe all Men. I never put pen to paper with any ſuch preſumption or hopes, the beſt Men, and the best Chriſtians is my chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſign to gratifie; but even in that alſo, I fear I ſhall miſs much of my aim, and deſires; divers Men, tho good Men, having divers judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and divers intereſts, and according to divers Lights, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers underſtandings; and Eccleſiasticks as well as others are ſubject to the Inchantments of Paſſion, Ends, Intereſt, and Parties. Tho I
<pb facs="tcp:50679:3"/>am no Prophet, nor yet Son of a Prophet, yet I do foreſee that there is a Generation of Men, worthy, and learned, who tho of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions among themſelves in affairs of their own function, that yet will all unite and center in cenſuring of me, as if I leapt out of my own Province into theirs, to viſit their tranſactions; but I have learnt of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that it is arrogance in no Man, either to ſeek, or aſſert truth, it being an equal Crime of the ſame nature, both to conceal truth, and divulge untruths. The <hi>Proteſtant Clergy,</hi> I doubt not but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is <hi>evers Man's duty and concern</hi> to be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and as Chriſtians their undeniable right <hi>to try Spirits and to examine by the Scriptures, whether the things our Prieſts do teach us, are ſo in truth or no.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves did ſubject their Preachments to the judgments of their Auditors, and I never heard that Proteſtant Divines did ever pretend to greater Abilities than they had, or to any Infallibility: and if we poor Laicks ſhould not be left to our own free judgments and examinations, what better choice can we make, than to philip Croſs or Pile, whether to be Prelate, Presbyter, Independant, Quaker or Phanatick, Proteſtant or Papist, Turk or Jew. Wherefore hath God differenced us from Bruits, by giving us light of Reaſon and of Conſcience, if others muſt have the guidance and cuſtody of them, and we be led Captive by the Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of other men. We ought no more to rely on another man's light of Reaſon or of Conſcience, than on another man's eyes to ſee or legs to walk withall. This were but to put <hi>a Cheat upon our ſelves,</hi> and to caſt the care of our Faith and Religion upon others, as if not worthy our own care or concern, or as if we be ſeduced, <hi>they, not we, were to anſwer for it.</hi> God's Precepts were not given to <hi>Popes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Prieſts, Councils, Synods</hi> or particular <hi>Churches,</hi> or to great <hi>Clarks</hi> only, but to <hi>every Individual,</hi> and every man ought to act according as he is perſwaded in his own <hi>Heart,</hi> we are <hi>Diſciples</hi> only, not <hi>Slaves.</hi> Beſides are not <hi>Laicks Prieſts</hi> alſo? Is it not <hi>Goſpel? He hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Rev. <hi>1.6.</hi> and for certain the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> are not the <hi>Clergies Peculiar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. As to the <hi>Romiſh Clergy,</hi> I have much more to ſay unto them, not expecting any juſt or fair dealing from them, for that they have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us far worſe than the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for they held them in Bondage but four hundred and thirty years, but the <hi>Roman Pontiffs</hi> have evilly treated us more than that time twice told; treated us indeed after a very ſtrange rate, as if we could not tell ten, or as if
<pb facs="tcp:50679:4"/>we did not know our right hands from our left: Treated us as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> put out our eyes, and then make ſport with us: our underſtandings muſt be captivated to the <hi>Popes</hi> bare <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or againſt Reaſon or Scripture, or indeed againſt our very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and we muſt be content to be <hi>led</hi> blindfold into the Abyſs of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and deſtruction where <hi>Abbaddon</hi> reigns, and made believe it is our happineſs ſo to be; as if ignorance in good earneſt were the Mother of Devotion. <hi>Dominus Deus noſter Papa,</hi> like <hi>God</hi> on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> thundring out his Interdicts, that none preſume to go up into the Mount, nor yet to touch but the border of it, not ſo much as to peep into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture without leave, forſooth, least we be ſhot thro with the dart of <hi>Ex-communication,</hi> or drawn into the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> tho all Scripture was given indifferently to all Men by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as their only Patent and Evidence for their Inheritance reſerved for them in Heaven; and is in its own nature <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction, for Righteouſneſs, 2 Tim. 3.10.</hi> and tho we are commanded to <hi>ſearch them, for that in them we have eternal Life, 5 John 39.</hi> But this ought to be no wonderment to any that they who have kept us <hi>blindfold</hi> ſo long, ſhould yet deſire to keep us <hi>hood-winkt</hi> ſtill. Heroick and publick ſpirited minds, tho long plaid upon, and abuſ'd with ſhadow of Reaſon and uſurped Powers, will at length find words and reaſons to eaſe and right themſelves. Every Man is too apt to indulge his own fancy, and opinions; yea, and intitle <hi>God</hi> and his Word, to the favouring of them alſo, we ſhall be all ſaved or damned according to what our ſelves (not what our Prieſts) do believe and practiſe. Publick refutation of errors (tho long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and tho contrary to the deſign and intereſt of ſome, and thoſe no ſmall ones) hath in its own nature more of Candour and ſweetneſs, than of Gall, and ought ſo to be eſteemed: He doth too proudly ſcorn his own imperfections and corrupted nature, that bluſheth to think that he can err: and as they betray too much ſelfiſhneſs and weakneſs, who dare not write or ſpeak <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo do they much more, that for ends, not good, are afraid that <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould come to light. Nature hath not left the moſt beautiful fleſh and blood without ſome moles, ſome blemiſhes. The Church on Earth, tho lovely, yet is not without her <hi>Naevi,</hi> ſome blackneſs with her oomelineſs, and to flatter her Children in them, is worſe than to write a Satyr againſt them. As Revenge is not more due to any Injuries, than unto thoſe that are committed againſt the <hi>Church;</hi> ſo no Benefits are more valuable than thoſe that are done unto the <hi>Church.</hi> In all Writings great care ought to be taken to write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might give offence, nor to omit any thing that can be ſaid in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb facs="tcp:50679:4"/>of <hi>Truth,</hi> without ſuffering our Pens to run riot in any thing, which by interpretation might be drawn into offence, altho the malicious ſubtilties and prevaricating Wits of ſome hath made it appear, that there can be nothing ſo moderately ſpoken, which is not ſubject to depraved expoſitions. My main deſign is to diſcover <hi>Truth, ſine formidine oppoſiti,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect or dread of any interest or party; <hi>Amicus Praeſul, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Presbyter, Amicus Independens, ſed magis amica Veritas.</hi> I am not ignorant how imprudent it is to diſoblige, or anger great Men, or any Party, or indeed any number of men. I have taſted of that ſowr grape already, tho by endeavors only to find out <hi>Truth</hi> by diſcourſing of it, but that Spirit is wretchedly mean, that dares not write or ſpeak <hi>Truth,</hi> without a ſneaking and pitiful Apology. If we had thoſe hungring, thirſting, and moſt ardent affections to all ſincere uncorrupted and heavenly Truths, which are proportional to that Spirit of Chriſt, which is, or ought to be in us, there would not be ſuch bitter Conteſts and Animoſities as are amongſt us for trivials, things rather reſpecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Domination, than the ſincere Word of Truth, which adds value and honor to every Aſſerter thereof, but receives no value from any Man. I have endeavoured <hi>quantum in me,</hi> to do that right to all Perſwaſions, as to urge what may moſt conduce to the making good of the ſame, and what their cauſe will rationally bear, and that in terms plain and perſpicuous, without School-tricks. If I have miſſed of my aim, the Reaſon is at hand, <hi>Bernardus non vidit omnia,</hi> no more Oraculous or infallible than themſelves.</p>
            <p>They that ſee best, ſee at beſt but thro a Glaſs darkly, even the Scribes, the Wiſe and the Diſputers of this World, are many times both far from Certainty, and far from Truth, and no wonder: <hi>Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this World? 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1.20.</hi> Elias <hi>cum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit, ſolvit dubia.</hi>

All which he endeavours to make good by four Spiritual Reaſons, as he calls them, as on a firm ſquare.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That Proteſtants have no other Divine Rule or Authority from without them, warrantable to one another, as a common ground, but the Scripture; and no other within them, but the illumination of the Spirit ſo interpreting that Scripture as warrantable only to our ſelves, and to ſuch whoſe Conſciences we can ſo perſwade can have no other ground in matter of Religion, but only from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And theſe being not poſſible to be underſtood without the Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which no man can know at all times to be in himſelf, much leſs to be at any time for certain in any other, it muſt follow, That no Man, or Body of Men, can be the infallible Judges, or Determiners, in matters of Religion to any other Mens Conſciences but their own, <hi>f.</hi> 6. Wherefore if we count it a crime for Papiſts to believe only as the Church believes, how much greater crime will it be for a Proteſtant to believe as the State believes? And it being the general conſent of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50679:6"/>Writers, That neither Traditions, nor Councils, nor Canons of any viſible Church, much leſs any Edicts of any Magiſtrate or Civil Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but the Scripture only can be the ſinal Judge or Rule, in matters of Religion, <hi>f.</hi> 7. and that only in the Conſcience of every Chriſtian to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which Proteſtation made by the firſt publick Reformers of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt the Imperial Edicts of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> impoſing Church-Traditions without Scripture, gave firſt beginning to the Name of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:</hi> And therefore the Conſcience not being the Magiſtrates Province, he ought not to force or impoſe, becauſe he hath no right to judge; and yet when he comes to the Toleration of Popery, he ſeems to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, averring.</p>
               <p>§. But as for Popery and Idolatry, why they alſo may not hence plead to be tolerated, I have much leſs to ſay: For that their Religion, the more conſidered, the leſs can be acknowledged a Religion, but a <hi>Roman Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality</hi> rather, he might have ſaid an <hi>entire Apoſtacy</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtolick Faith,</hi> endeavouring to keep up her old univerſal Dominion, under a new Name, and meer Shadow of Catholick Religion, being more rightly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>Catholick Hereſie</hi> againſt the Scripture, ſupported mainly by a Civil, and (except in <hi>Rome</hi>) by a Forreign Power; Juſtly therefore to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, not tolerated by the Magiſtrate of another Country; beſides of an implicit Faith which they profeſs, the Conſcience alſo becomes impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, and ſo by <hi>voluntary ſervitude</hi> to Mans Law, doth <hi>forfeit</hi> her Chriſtian Liberty; who then can plead for ſuch a Conſcience, as, being implicitly enthralled to Man in ſtead of God, almoſt becomes no Conſcience, as the Will, not free, becomes no Will? Nevertheleſs, if they ought not to be tolerated, it is for juſt reaſon of State, more than of Religion; which they who force, though profeſſing to be Proteſtants, deſerve as little to be tolerated themſelves, being no leſs guilty of Popery in the moſt Popiſh Point. And for Idolatry, who knows it not to be evident againſt all Scripture, Old and New, and therefore a true Hereſie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impiety, wherein a right Conſcience can have nought to do, and the work thereof ſo manifeſt, that a Magiſtrate can hardly err in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting and quite removing at leaſt the publick and ſcandalous uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Scriptural Reaſon is, If we ſhould grant the Civil Magiſtrate were able to judge in thoſe things; yet as a Civil Magiſtrate he hath no right, becauſe Chriſt hath a Government of his own ſufficient of it ſelf to all its ends and purpoſes in governing his Church, and is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the Civil Magiſtrate: <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe it deals only with the Inward Man, and his Actions, which are all Spiritual, and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force not liable: <hi>2dly.</hi> To ſhew us the Divine Excellency of his Spiritual Kingdom, able without worldly force to ſubdue all the Powers and Kingdoms of this World, which are upheld by outward force only: That the Inward Man is nothing elſe but the Inward part of Man, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and his Will, and that his Actions thence proceeding, yet not ſimply thence, but from the Work of Divine Grace upon them, are the whole matter of Religion under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Scriptural Reaſon, is from the wrong the Civil Power doth with its Force or Impoſition, by violating the Fundamental Priviledge of the Goſpel, the new birth-right of every true Believers Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50679:6"/>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth Scriptural Reaſon,</hi> is from the conſideration of all thoſe ends which the Magiſtrate can pretend to the interpoſing of his force therein; which can hardly be other than, <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Glory of God, <hi>2dly.</hi> The Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good of them, whom he forceth: or <hi>3dly.</hi> The Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſcandal to others.</p>
               <p>§. Mr. <hi>P. N.</hi> in his Treatiſe of the ſame Subject,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. N.</hi> his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>P.</hi> 22.</note> with the other of <hi>J. M.</hi> is far more ingenious herein, not only aſſerting the Supremacy and Authority of all Kings and Civil Magiſtrates in general over all perſons, and things Eccleſiaſtical both by Scripture, Reaſon, and Authentick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but alſo of our Kings in particular, moſt pertinently and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly out of our own Municipal Laws and Conſtitutions to boot: He doth therein alſo as ſtrongly aſſert Independency, which rightly ſtated, and rightly underſtood, is without doubt the Tenent and Practice of our Church both by Scripture, and by the Opinion of ſound Judicious and Orthodox Divines, very great Friends unto, and Contenders for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and others: But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of Churches, which theſe Men and others as Orthodox as themſelves plead for, is not altogether the ſame with that which <hi>P. N.</hi> and other his Aſſociates do contend for: Theſe Men maintain, that an Unity of Diſcipline, or Coactive Laws, full power of Juriſdiction, or Independant Judicature, is not ſeated in any one Church or Perſon, (Pope, or other to whom all other Churches and Perſons muſt vail Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and ſubmit) but the ſame power is in each of thoſe Churches; and this they maintain againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who do not only hold this Unity of Independent Judicature to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Conſtitution of the Viſible Catholick Church, but that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt be <hi>radically</hi> in <hi>one perſon,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Pope,</hi> on whom, as upon the Head and Fountain, the unity of the Holy Catholick viſible Church doth depend; and for this reaſon they put his Holineſs into the <hi>definition</hi> of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> and contrary to this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines do maintain, That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other National Churches, have a Diſcipline of Government and Judicature within themſelves, Independent of any other Perſon, Church or Power. And this is the Drift and Scope both of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> and others, in their ſeveral Treatiſes.</p>
               <p>§. That which <hi>P. N.</hi> contends for in the Congregational (termed alſo the Independant) way is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That thoſe who are called out of the World by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, have power given them by Chriſt, being a competent Number, to gather themſelves together in his Name, and judge their Warrant to be from 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> And a Church ſo gathered becomes a Body or Spiritual Corporation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned thus by mutual Aſſent of each Perſon, have power one over another, as in all Fraternities, and liberty from Chriſt to chooſe their Officers, cenſure Offenders, make Canons and Orders in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, for regulating their Affairs. And they further ſay; as the Church-Catholick in general, ſo each parcel of it, each particular Church hath Chriſt alſo for its Head, and in ſuch a union with him, and ſuch exiſtence in him, even as a <hi>Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 11.) as that if Perſons, making up this Body, be conſidered diſtinctly, and as incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated one with another only, and not in their relation to Chriſt alſo, as one with them, and chief in the midſt of them, 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>Where
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50679:7"/>two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> they are not a compleat Body, or Spiritual Politie: And upon this account it is they profeſs their dependency to be upon Chriſt alone for the government and manage of this his Kingdom: and thus being dependent upon Chriſt their only Law-giver, 4. <hi>Ja.</hi> 12. <hi>Who is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father,</hi> and beſt knoweth how to govern his own Houſe, they profeſs themſelves Independent in reſpect to the Authority or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of any other Perſon, Church, Synod, or meer Eccleſiaſtical Power whatſoever; yet notwithſtanding they own and ſubmit to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in Matters and Cauſes both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and ſo far as God hath given the Civil Magiſtrate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command and require. But finding in the Books of God, that there are ſome things of ſo miſterious, and of ſo Spiritual a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and peculiar to holy Worſhip; that Chriſt hath reſerved the ſole Menage thereof to be ordered by himſelf, as expreſſed in his Word, and no otherwiſe. Now although the Magiſtrate may and ought to require of his Subjects due obedience to ſuch duties, yet ought he not by any Laws or Statutes that he ſhall enact in this kind, either add, alter, or diminiſh any thing Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed, either in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or neceſſary circumſtance thereof; and if he ſhall ſo do, the Churches are required of the Lord, (the one Law giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy) 4. <hi>James</hi> 12. not to be ſubject, 2 <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 20. And it is a ſin for them, through fear of Man, or the like temptation, to obſerve and keep ſuch Statutes; and for this they bring 6. <hi>Mich.</hi> 16. For the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Omri are kept, and all the works of the Houſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and ye walk in their Councils,</hi> &amp;c. And in this ſenſe only they profeſs themſelves ſubject to the Civil Magiſtrates ſupremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and go no further; and in this alſo reſerve to themſelves the ſole judgment of what matters are thus meerly ſpiritual, and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Worſhip of God. So that if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſhall, out of a good intention, appoint Ceremonies, or ſuch like helps, for the ſtirring up our dull minds, and to make the Worſhip of God more edifying; or ſhall appoint a day to be obſerved, as ſacred in the Remembrance of the Birth, or Reſurrection of Chriſt, or to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the bleſſed Virgin, or holy Apoſtles, if the Magiſtrate, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter government of the Church, eſtabliſh Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any Officers that are not appointed by Chriſt himſelf, they will by no means ſubmit, but chooſe rather to ſuffer, which they term Paſſive Obedience.</q> Thus far <hi>P.

               <p>§. But thoſe Reverend Authors <hi>Bilſon</hi> and others, conſidering the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate is highly reſponſable, being appointed by the Lord as <hi>Cuſtos utriuſ<expan>

And God having truſted him with Authority in theſe things, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity alſo belong to him to judge what Crimes fall within his Province and Cognizance, and accordingly to apply himſelf as the Miniſter of God for incouragement to thoſe that are good, and to execute wrath upon them that do evil.

               <p>§. Others, as Mr. <hi>John Robinſon</hi> in his Apology in Juſtification of the ſame Tenets endeavours to prove the ſame, averring, <q>That by Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scriptures, ſpeaking definitely of viſible Miniſterial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, no other is to be underſtood ordinarily at leaſt than one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation met together in one place in ſuch competent numbers, as that they may all hear and underſtand one another, 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17, 20. <hi>If he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: for where two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them: And, when you are gathered together, and my Spirit with the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4. <hi>All that believed were together, and had all things common,</hi> 2.

Acts 17, 28. That ye <hi>take heed unto all the Flock whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.

We may not therefore, ſaith he, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Antiquity, Unity, humane Prudence, or any Colour whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remove the Ancient Bounds of the viſible, and miniſterial Church, which our firſt and right Fathers, to wit, Apoſtles have ſet, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of whom the moſt ancient of thoſe, which are ſo called, are but Infants and beardleſs. <hi>There is indeed one Church, one Body, one Spirit, one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> i. e. <hi>of one Kind and Nature,</hi> not one in number, as one Sea: Neither was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apoſtles days more one with the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> than was the Baptiſm of <hi>Peter</hi> one with <hi>Pauls</hi> Baptiſm, or than <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were one; neither was <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> more one whole intire perfect Man (conſiſting of their Parts Eſſential and Integral) without relation to other Men, than is a particular Congregation right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtituted and ordered.

                  <note place="margin">Paraeneſis.</note> and lay it down as a general Precaution, (relating to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50679:8"/>of Texts of Scripture) to which the Reader is to have reſpect throughout this Book in treating and handling of all Opinions, which are divers and not few, <hi>viz.</hi> It ſtands not with the Wiſdom and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no, nor yet with the ſincerity of Eccleſiaſticks, how great ſoever, how illuminated, or how ſincere ſoever they would be thought to be, to alledge in favour of their Opinions, Places and Texts of Scripture in a forreign or uncouth, if not contrary ſence to their own moſt natural meaning, by urging ſome ambiguous or doubtful terms or Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that poſſibly may have a double meaning, and accordingly ſetling a Poſition on ſome portion of Scripture in the one ſenſe, which is true, and thereby purchaſing ſome Credit, and aſſent in the Readers minds by ſuch Scripture Allegations, and then in the Cloſe conclude in another ſenſe, which is not true, or contrary, or at beſt, not applicable to the Premiſſes or Poſitions firſt laid down. It is, I take it, a received Axiome amongſt Divines, that that ſenſe of Scripture which agreeth beſt with the literal words thereof is moſt genuine, and moſt eſpecially to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, and that which is farther fetcht, as moſt forreign, ſo leaſt to be relyed on. God be thanked, this latter Generation is now come <hi>ex ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> out of its minority, and wardſhip, wherein it hath been long held Captive by blind obedience and <hi>Romiſh Tyranny,</hi> and begins now to reliſh, and judge of Spiritual Viands, not by the quality or condition, or taſt of them that cook it, or ſerve it up unto us, but by the ſavoury taſt it hath of its own. Indeed it is obſervable, that an inordinate affection to find fault, or to bring over others, that are of a different perſwaſion, to their own Opinions,<note place="margin">Volendi valde quicquid vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt.</note> (of which they are ſo ſingularly fond, that they on all occaſions ſcruple not to intitle God and his Word to the patronage of them) doth oftentimes tranſport Men, yea zealous, pious Men, no leſs than any other affection whatſoever.

Perſons of great Learning and Reputation in the World ought above others to be ſo juſt, as not to urge Scripture Allegations purpoſely to amuze or ſeduce the Readers, but to look back unto the very Spring and Fountain wherefore they were recorded by the Prophets and Apoſtles, and then to urge them in the trueſt underſtanding and intent thereof,<note place="margin">☞</note> out of which no Writers with ſincerity ſhould dare with Sophiſtical Schoolies to ſeek or endeavour to carry them, leſt otherwiſe their Readers, much biaſſed with the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Integrity of their Perſons, be thereby blindly led into errors by other Mens Paſſions and Intereſt. So to handle Scripture is no new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, it was a trick even in our Saviours days, and practiſed upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the putting of a wrong gloſs upon Chriſts Word, 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 58. made an evil ingredient towards his Condemnation. The Phariſes were moſt excellently gifted in this Art; one while when <hi>Paul</hi> manifeſted Chriſts appearance unto <hi>them once in the way to</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and afterwards in the Temple,</hi> commanding them to preach his Reſurrection to the Gentiles; they then with great indignation cryed, <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50679:8"/>Earth, for it is not ſit that he ſhould live,</hi> 22. Acts 8.17.18.22. Another while to ſerve their own turns and party againſt the Saduces, (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all Apparition of Spirit or Angel, or hope of Reſurrection from the dead, which the Phariſes confeſs) <hi>Pauls</hi> conformity with the Phariſes in manifeſti g and proving the Reſurrection from the dead, doth reliſh ſo well with them, that his other particular differences, or diſſentions from them, no way diſpleaſes them. For he giving expreſs Teſtimony, that Chriſt, whom they had crucified, did appear unto him, did ſo pleaſe their humour, that the Scribes which were on the Phariſes part acquitted him by Proclamation, <hi>viz. We find no evil in this Man, but if a Spirit or Angel hath ſpoken unto him, let us not fight against God,</hi> 23. Acts 9. This they did not out of true love to <hi>Paul,</hi> or to the <hi>Truth</hi> he taught, but from love of themſelves, their Party, and their Opinions, and from jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous impatiency of contradiction in publick by an Inferiour Sect; ſo when Chriſt had fully ſatisfied a curious queſtion captiouſly propoſed by the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> by proving the Reſurrection out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of</hi> Iſaack, <hi>and of</hi> Jacob; certain of them anſwered, <hi>Maſter, thou haſt well ſaid,</hi> 20. Luke 39. Though the <hi>Phariſes</hi> were well pleaſed of his Probat of the Reſurrection againſt the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> yet for all that they could judge him to death, for avouching himſelf to be the great Judge of thoſe that were raiſed from the dead; whereby it appears, that both their approbation, and condemnation of our Saviour in theſe particulars, did iſſue out of one and the ſame corrupt, and monſtrous Fountain, that could ſend forth ſweet water and bitter, 3. <hi>James</hi> 11. <hi>viz.</hi> from love of their Party, love of Authority over the People, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Men, from a ſtubborn opiniative and envious deſire to excel their oppoſites, and not to be excelled by any; ſo when <hi>John</hi> came neither eating nor drinking, yet they ſay, <hi>he hath a Devil;</hi> and when the Son of Man came both eating and drinking, then, <hi>Behold a Man gluttonous, and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> 11. Mat. 18, 19. The <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> in this kind were in ſome meaſure more ingenious than the <hi>Jews;</hi> for when Chriſt had diſobliged them by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out, as ſoon as they ſaw him, they fell down before him, and cryed, <hi>Thou art the Son of God,</hi> 3. Mark 10. But the <hi>Scribes</hi> which came down from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid he hath <hi>Belzabub,</hi> and by the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> caſteth he out <hi>Devils,</hi> 21. Acts 22. So the <hi>Jews</hi> were pleaſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full nor faſting. Thus can perverſe Spirits and Wits turn and wind any thing never ſo innocently and plainly ſpoken, or written, unto a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or contrary ſence. The ſame Spirit of Contention and way-ward emulation reigns at this day through Chriſtendome, and rageth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no leſs in defence of good Cauſes than of bad, and makes many to concur with Schiſmatical or falſe Opinions, in transforming particular places of Scripture, which makes for private deſires or deſigns, as facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppoſition to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> to conſent unto our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Points mentioned.</p>
               <p>§. The <hi>Monks, Friars,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> like the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> are rare <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> can handy dandy, ſhuffle and cut Texts of Scripture with moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable dexterity. Their impertinent Collections to prove <hi>Purgatory</hi> from ſuch places of Scripture, as have no other ſemblance with it, ſave only, that they mention Metaphorical Fire, would make an impartial Reader call to mind the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Monkies,</hi> who eſpying <hi>Glow-worms</hi> in the night, gathered ſticks, and blowed themſelves breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50679:9"/>to make them burn: Would not Impudence it ſelf bluſh, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity tremble at the ſenſeleſs collections and deduction of theſe Men.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and among them the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> more eſpecially have no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel except the <hi>Jews</hi> in this kind; ſo in other main Points of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as concerning the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>real Preſence,</hi> their <hi>Prayers</hi> in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue,</hi> and the like, they do not go ſo much beyond others, as beſides themſelves. The extream deſire they have, that Sacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould countenance and abet their profitable Tenents, makes them wreſt and transform Places of Scripture beyond all Conſtruction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they do not manifeſt the Truth, but the poyſon of their Doctrines, and their Zeal, and earneſtneſs herein to be a Spice or Symptome of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual madneſs or Phanaticiſme.</p>
               <p>Muſing and dreaming are of near alliance: He that thinks of nothing but of confirming his own concluſions or apprehenſions, will quickly perſwade himſelf, that the Word of God ſpeaks juſt ſo. As the Fool thinketh, ſo the Bell clinketh; the ſuperſtitious <hi>Phiſiognomer</hi> and <hi>Palmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> are not without their Scripture, 13. <hi>Ex.</hi> 9. <hi>And it ſhall be a ſign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and that in 37. <hi>Job.</hi> 7. <hi>he ſealeth up the hand of every Man, that all Men may know his Work.</hi> What is this elſe but to make deformed Pictures of beautiful Colours, or ſenſeleſs and ridiculous Inferences out of Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Antecedents, or of plain Texts of Scripture: Except we do ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compare the Marginal Quotations of ſome Jeſuitical, Anabaptiſtical, Quaking, and Schiſmatical diſcourſes with the Texts, and both with the Concluſions intended by the Author, one would hardly believe it poſſible for ſome Men to ſpeak or write nothing but Goſpel-language, and yet to ſpeak or write ſcarce a true or wiſe or pertinent word to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Deſire of Victory, and to excel others, is a Diſeaſe hardly cured in any Men, Sects or Parties, and oft-times work moſt indefatigably where it works moſt ſecretly. Gods Gifts of Wit, Learning and Judgment ſome can admire, and magnifie in others, and acknowledge them to be above their own: yet will they not in concluſion be perſwaded, that any Men, not of their <hi>own Sect</hi> or Opinion, have ſo pure and <hi>clear a Beam of Light</hi> as themſelves, or know ſo much of Gods Eternal Will and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they do; and it is no marvel, that ſuch who for expounding grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Myſteries have betaken themſelves wholly to the Spirit, or to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Men, whom they preſume to be throughly ſanctified, <hi>i. e.</hi> that are <hi>free</hi> of their <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> and Corporation only, or at leaſt ſerved a compleat Apprentiſhip to their ſuppoſed Spirit. But the wiſeſt oft miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in their Projects, and ſo do theſe, by taking wrong meaſures, in that they think there is no direct way to Grace but by undervaluing helps of Art or gifts of Nature; of this miſconceit the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts,</hi> the <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> are moſt guilty. The firſt and immediate Iſſue of this Perſwaſion is, that every action which is not warranted by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Rule of Scripture apprehended by Grace, is not of Faith, and being not of Faith, it muſt be a ſin; ſo that theſe two Propoſitions, 1. All A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions warranted by the expreſs Word of God muſt needs be lawful; 2. All lawful Actions muſt needs be warranted by the expreſs Word of God, differ no more in their Logical and Grammatical ſence, than houſe-keeping and keeping houſe do in common underſtanding; <hi>utitur Diabolus Teſtimoniis Scripturarum non ut doceat ſed ut fallat,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> That

               <p>§. Having thus precautioned the Readers by a General and Impartial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, being as lyable to the laſh thereof my ſelf (if a tranſgreſſor) as any other without any particular reflection, and much leſs upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures immediately foregoing, brought by the Independants, upon which it may ſeem to have moſt reflection, as being inſerted in the very rear, and next adjoyning unto them: yet I muſt ſay, that unto my apprehenſion there is generally a vein of fallacy, or (to expreſs it as modeſtly as the caſe will bear) of Miſapplication runs through very many of their Scriptural quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, applying that which is meant of the Church in one ſence, unto that which is to be underſtood of the Church in another ſence, or that which is meant of a <hi>National Church,</hi> or of a <hi>City Church;</hi> as of that of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or of thoſe famous <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> unto every petit Congregation, and the like, concerning the powers of <hi>Churches</hi> and the uſe of the term <hi>Liberty</hi> and the like. Though I am thus Opiniated, yet I muſt ſay withal, that were the Scene of the <hi>Church</hi> laid in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or any <hi>Heatheniſh, Gentile,</hi> or <hi>Savage Country,</hi> profeſſed enemies to the Goſpel and Croſs of Chriſt, where no Legiſlative power taketh Gods pure Religion into their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I could have much leſs to ſay againſt them, but until better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt acknowledge them a very plauſible, if not a full proof of their Independency; but the Scene being laid here in a Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, I ſuppoſe they will come very ſhort of proof.</p>

So there is nothing which ſooner precipitates, both the more and leſs learned into errors, than Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of names or words, including in them diverſity of ſignifications or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portances; and conſequently each ſeveral ſignification or importance, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways incroaching upon the Powers, Attributes, or Prerogatives which moſt properly appertain to ſome other more prime and principal. Now the beſt way to prevent the inconveniences whereunto the multiplicity and diverſity of its ſignifications or acceptations do expoſe us, is in reading; firſt to conſider of the Powers, Attributes, Prerogatives, or Royalties which belong either ſolely or principally unto it, and then to value the other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications or importances, and rate their ſeveral Attributes or Properties by the nearneſs or remoteneſs of their affinity with it, or reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>§. The <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt which we term his Body myſtical, can be but One, and that only apprehenſible by the intellectual conceipt of our minds, and not ſenſibly to be diſcerned by any of us, for that ſome are in Heaven, and ſome on Earth; and though the perſons of thoſe on earth be viſible, yet we cannot know that they are truly and infallibly of that Body, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their hearts, and Faith being to us inviſible, and to God only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50679:10"/>and individually known, yet may we rationally know, that there is ſuch a reall Body; a Body collective, conſiſting of many; a Body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, becauſe the myſtery of their conjunction is removed altogether from our ſenſes. <hi>All are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael, Rom.</hi> 9.6. and no mortal can infallibly diſtinguiſh them. It was Chriſt only that knew <hi>Nathaniel to be a true Iſraelite indeed, in whom was no guile, John</hi> 21.15. Many may <hi>propheſie, cast out Devils, and do wonderful works in Christs Name, Matth.</hi> 22. and yet be deceivers, whom God only can know and diſtinguiſh. But this Church is not the proper ſubject of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>§. As the everlaſting promiſes of love, mercy, and bleſſedneſs belongs unto the myſtical Church; even ſo when we read of any duty which the Church of God is obliged unto, the Church which this doth concern is a ſenſibly known Company; and this viſible Church in like ſort is but one ſucceſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the beginning of the World, and will continue untill time ſhall be no more; and which conſiſts partly of Members before, and partly of Members ſince the coming of Chriſt; and which have already, and which ſhall hereafter embrace the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> we term as by a more proper Name the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> whereof <hi>there are many Members, yet but one Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. And therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> affirmeth plainly all men Chriſtian, be they <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bond or free, they are all incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into one Company, they all make but <hi>one Body, that he might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile both unto God in</hi> One Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16. <hi>that the Gentiles ſhould be fellow heirs alſo and of the ſame Body,</hi> Eph. 3.6. <hi>And they all profeſſing one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, Eph.</hi> 4.5.

               <p>§. For preſervation even of Chriſtianity, and of Chriſtian unity, peace, and concord, there is not any thing more needful and requiſite, than that ſuch as are of the <hi>Viſible Church</hi> have mutual fellowſhip and ſociety one with another. In which conſideration, to uſe their own ſimile, As the Sea or Collection of waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.10. being one, one in nature, yet not one in name and number; for that within divers precincts it hath divers names, as the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> ſo the Catholick <hi>Viſible Church</hi> is in like ſort divided into a number of diſtinct Societies, every of which is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Church</hi> within it ſelf. In this ſenſe the <hi>Church</hi> is always a viſible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men; not meerly an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> but a <hi>Society.</hi> For though the name of <hi>Church</hi> be given unto <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> and though any number of Chriſtian men congregated may <hi>quodam ſenſu</hi> be termed <hi>a Church,</hi> yet Aſſemblies properly are rather things that belong to the <hi>Church</hi> than the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, men are aſſembled for performance of publick Actions, which Actions being ended, the Aſſembly diſſolveth it ſelf, and is no longer in being; whereas the <hi>Church</hi> which was aſſembled doth no leſs continue afterwards than before: Where but three are, and they of the Laity alſo, there is a <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian Aſſembly.</hi> But a <hi>Church,</hi> as in this diſcourſe we ought to underſtand it, is a Society, or a Fraternity (to uſe their own terms ſtill) <hi>i. e.</hi> a number of men belonging unto ſome Chriſtian Fellowſhip, the place and limits whereof is certain, and who are endued with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers, attributes, and properties to govern it ſelf; and this Church is the moſt proper ſubject of this diſcourſe, which doth neither exclude the Members of the holy <hi>Church</hi> Triumphant or Militant, nor yet conſiſts only of them, or of men internally, though ineffectually called; but of them and of others called only <hi>vocatione merè externa,</hi> by vocation meerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50679:10"/>Thus the ſeveral ſocieties of Chriſtian men, unto every one of which the name of <hi>Church</hi> is rightfully attributed, as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, France, Spain, England,</hi> and, as of old, the ſeven <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which certainly hold a nearer reſemblance unto <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Provincial Churches,</hi> than unto the <hi>Gathered Congregations;</hi> for moſt certainly each of theſe had certain particular Congregations under them, as <hi>London</hi> hath, muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with correſpondent general properties, and powers belonging of right unto them as they are publick Chriſtian Societies. And all the powers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt to the <hi>Churches Militant,</hi> or to viſible <hi>Miniſterial Churches,</hi> are moſt properly attributed to ſuch <hi>Churches,</hi> and not to thoſe where two or three, or ſome few only in reſpect of the whole are gathered, and ſuch are our <hi>Independent Churches</hi> here in reſpect of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> and ſuch like are our ſeveral Pariſhes, which more properly and ſtrictly ought to be accounted of as <hi>Members,</hi> or <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> than ſo many ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> endued with ſuch powers; though in common diſcourſes we may allow them the title or appellation of <hi>Churches,</hi> yet in diſcourſes of this nature being diſputative, they ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>§. Unto the Attributes or Prerogatives attributed to the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> or unto the Promiſes annexed unto it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Viſible Miniſterial Churches</hi> have no claim or title, ſave only in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or reflection, or in expectancy; <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is only inſtated in the Bleſſings, Prerogatives, and Promiſes made unto the <hi>Church;</hi> yet from this Body, or rather from Chriſt the Head of this Body, both Bleſſings and Powers do immediately and ſucceſſively <hi>(like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of his Garments)</hi> deſcend though in different Meaſures unto the ſeveral Members of it, as unto <hi>National Churches,</hi> more and greater Powers; and unto the ſeveral Congregations thereof Bleſſings and Powers, though not in the ſame meaſure and fullneſs; and indeed by Analogie and Participation unto all and every one that hath put on Chriſt by profeſſion. Thus we are to conceive of the Catholick Church as of one entire Body made up by the Collection and aggregation of all the faithful unto the unity thereof, from which union there ariſeth unto every one of them ſuch a relation unto, and ſuch a dependance upon the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> as parts uſe to have in reſpect of the whole: whereupon it followeth, that neither particular perſons, nor <hi>particular Churches</hi> are to work as ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Bodies by themſelves, which is the ground of all Schiſm; but to teach, and to be taught, and to do all other Chriſtian duties, as parts conjoyned unto the whole, and Members of the ſame Common-wealth or Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore the Biſhops of the Antient Church, though they had the government of particular Congregations only committed unto them, yet in regard of this Communion which they had with the univerſal, did uſually take to themſelves the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which maketh ſtrongly as well againſt the new Separatiſts as the old <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who either hold it a thing not much material, ſo they profeſs the Faith of Chriſt, whether they do it in the Catholick Communion, or out of it; or elſe which is worſe, dote ſo much upon the perfection of their own Party, that they refuſe to joyn in fellowſhip with the reſt of the body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as if they themſelves were the only people of God, and all wiſdom muſt live and die with them and their Generation.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50679:11"/>
               <p>§. To proſecute their own ſimile of Fraternities or Corporations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they claim a power over one another by conſent or agreement: Be it that every <hi>Church</hi> exceeds an ordinary Aſſembly or Multitude, in that it is a Society of Men incorporated, and every Corporation or Society corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſuppoſeth an unity more than meerly local between the Members thereof, an Union by Laws and Statutes; or elſe they were no more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant than ſo many men meeting at a Play or Whitſun-Ale, <hi>quod non est aliquid formatum, non est aliquid vere unum;</hi> that which hath no ſet form or faſhion can have no true real unity; for it is the form of every thing which giveth it a diſtinct entity or unity. Hence it is that though all men are mortal, yet Corporations conſiſting of ſuch mortal men, are yet accounted immortal, becauſe their Laws and Ordinances is the life, the ſoul, and ſpirit of every Corporation or Body Civil, every Church in what uſual ſenſe ſoever it be taken, is a Society or Body Politick, though every Society or Body Politick is not a <hi>Church.</hi> And that which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth the <hi>Church,</hi> properly ſo called, from a Society or Body meerly Civil, is the diverſity of Laws and Ordinances, and the different manner of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Members, All this is to fortifie and to make plain their ſimile, and which they will not gainſay.</p>
               <p>Yet withal I ſhall commit to their conſideration, that there are no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in <hi>England,</hi> nor in any well governed Commonwealth, without a proper Charter from the Crown and Laws of the Kingdom to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them to be a Corporation, and to make By-laws (as they call them) or to have power one over another: So none of them are independent of the publick Laws of the Kingdom or Nation whereof they are Subjects, or have any authority to form or eſtabliſh themſelves by any power of their own, but by what is derivative from ſome other power paramount. So alſo there is no Pariſh in <hi>England,</hi> nor any Company of Chriſtians that have power of themſelves ſo to confederat or congregat into a <hi>Church,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> as hath all the Powers and Attributes wherewith a <hi>National Church</hi> is endowed, and to meet as an <hi>Independent Congregation, to make Laws, chooſe Officers, cenſure Offenders, make Canons and Orders in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials</hi> without authority firſt obtained from the ſupreme Powers legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or without any Superviſors or Superintendents, or Laws over them: if every particle of the <hi>Church</hi> hath this power derived unto it from Chriſt, then certainly the ſame cannot be denied to a whole <hi>National Church;</hi> and whether be more juſt or equal that a part ſhould govern the whole, or the whole the parts, <hi>judg ye.</hi> Power to meet, to faſt, and pray, to break bread, and adminiſter Sacraments (which renders them capable of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a <hi>Church</hi>) cannot reaſonably and ordinarily be denied unto them; yet this doth no way qualifie them to be <hi>Independent.</hi> The ſtrength and virtue even of the Law of Nations is ſuch, that no particular Nation can lawfully prejudice the ſame by any their ſeveral Laws and Ordinances, more than a ſingle perſon by his private reſolutions can abrogate the Laws of a Nation wherein he lives. For as Civil Law being the Act of a whol Body Politick, doth therefore overrule each ſeveral part of the ſame Body, ſo there is no reaſon that any one Common-wealth it ſelf ſhould, to the prejudice of another, annul that whereupon the whole world hath agreed. Now as there is great cauſe of Communion, and conſequently of Laws for the maintenance of communion amongſt Nations; ſo amongſt Nations Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the like in regard even of Chriſtianity hath been always adjudged needful. And in this kind of correſpondence amongſt Nations, the force
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50679:11"/>of General Councils doth ſtand: For as one and the ſame Law divine is unto all <hi>Christian Churches</hi> a rule for the chiefeſt things, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they all in that reſpect make <hi>one Church,</hi> as having all but <hi>one Lord</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver Chriſt, one Faith, one Baptiſm, Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.

                  </gap> urgent neceſſities of mutual communion for propagation of the Goſpel, and for preſervation of unity in theſe things, as alſo for order in ſome other things convenient to be every where uniformily kept, maketh it requiſite that the <hi>Church</hi> of God here on earth have her Laws alſo of ſpiritual commerce between Chriſtian Nations; Laws by vertue whereof all <hi>Churches</hi> may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy freely the uſe of thoſe reverend, religious, and ſacred conſultations, which are termed <hi>Councils General,</hi> a thing whereof Gods own bleſſed Spirit was the Author; a thing practiſed by the holy Apoſtles themſelves; a thing always afterwards kept and obſerved throughout the world; a thing never otherwiſe than highly eſteemed of till pride, ambition, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny began by factions, and vile endeavours to abuſe that divine Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the furtherance of wicked purpoſes. But as the juſt Authority of Civil Courts, and Parliaments, is not therefore to be aboliſhed, becauſe ſometimes there is cunning uſed to frame them according to the private intents and intereſts of men over-potent in the Common-wealth; ſo the grievous abuſe which hath been of Councils, ſhould rather cauſe men to ſtudy how ſo gracious a thing may again be reduced to the firſt perfection, than in regard of the ſtains and blemiſhes ſithence growing be held for ever in extreme diſgrace. What hath been here affirmed of the Laws of Nations in general, and of General Councils, to make the thing we treat of more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and reaſonable, the ſame reaſons are as applicable and adequate to all intents and purpoſes of every particular Kingdom and Government, and runs parallel throughout all Laws both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> made by every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulat <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation;</hi> and it cannot be otherwiſe without ſhaking and hazarding the very foundation of all peaceable and good Governments in the World.

               </p>
               <p>I am verily perſwaded that it cannot demonſtratively be made appear by any, that every <hi>congregated Church</hi> in the beſt and pureſt times after the days of the Apoſtles, was a <hi>Plenipotentiary Church</hi> unto it ſelf to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes. I muſt confeſs that they would very much have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us, if they had at any time given us any one inſtance of ſuch a <hi>Church;</hi> but they having not yet done it, I take it for granted that it is not to be done; though if ſuch an inſtance could be made, yet the poſture of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons and affairs being ſo much different now from what it was then, may quite alter the caſe. I muſt confeſs it cannot reaſonably be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that it could then be otherwiſe, becauſe in thoſe days all Kingdoms
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50679:12"/>and Governments were ſo far from being friends to Chriſtianity or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, that they were all Perſecutors thereof, and therefore not poſſible that there ſhould be any National Churches, and happily were none till the lays of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperor.</p>
               <p>§. Their Maxim or Poſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That they who are called out of the world by the miniſtry of the Goſpel (as all Chriſtians are) have power given them by Christ, being a competent number, to gather themſelves together in his name.</hi> 2. <hi>That a Church ſo gathered becomes a Body or ſpiritual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and being joyned thus by mutual aſſent of each perſon, have power one over another (as in all Fraternities) and liberty from Chriſt to chooſe their Officers, cenſure Offenders, make Canons and Orders in Circumstantials</hi> for the regulating of their affairs.</p>
               <p>§. Unto the firſt part of their Poſition I can ſo far ſubſcribe, that it is tru, that where but two or three (whether with or without a Prieſt) are gathered together in Chriſts Name, the preſence of Chriſts Spirit is by promiſe annexed unto them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. and the particular Aſſemblies of Chriſtians were thereby intended and approved by Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to have communion in the publick exerciſe of holy duties mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42, 46. <hi>viz. breaking of bread and prayer.</hi> But that it doth deſcribe or purport a mutual agreement, which doth formally conſtitute them a <hi>Church Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> without any regard had to the <hi>National Church</hi> wherein they live, is not ſo very clear, the Text not warranting the ſame in the leaſt; if it do, then every Family by the ſame Text might claim Independency.</p>
               <p>§. As unto the other part of the Poſition I can by no means ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great qualifications. But if the ſecond part of their Poſition be tru of every particular Aſſembly, it muſt neceſſarily be much more tru of the whole or <hi>National Church,</hi> for which they were primarily given and ordained, and unto other <hi>Churches</hi> under the ſame Government but ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily and ſubordinat. Moreover conſider the <hi>Original Commiſſion</hi> for <hi>gathering of Churches; Go teach all Nations, and baptize them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Matth.</hi> 28.19. which Commiſſion was before the <hi>Church</hi> was cantonized into diviſions and ſubdiviſions by publick Authority, or the <hi>Independent Congregational Fraternities</hi> ſet up by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. The diſtinction of <hi>Churches</hi> fell out naturally and neceſſarily, as this or that City or Nation was here or there converted by ſome one or other of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, and ſo diviſion of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> came ſecondarily for convenient adminiſtration of Ordinances, and communication of Members. The fallacy or miſtake lies in the <hi>miſnomer,</hi> or miſapplication of terms. The Congregations in ſuch meetings termed <hi>Churches</hi> ought more properly to be called <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> than <hi>Churches,</hi> for they have not all the powers belonging to a <hi>Church</hi> more properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they being only <hi>partes ſimilares,</hi> Homogeneal parts of ſome more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire or ample viſible <hi>Church;</hi> in this ſenſe Families are ſometimes ſtiled <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. It follows, <hi>That a Church ſo qualified, and ſo gathered becomes a Body or ſpiritual Corporation,</hi> which may be, nay, which is tru in a qualified ſenſe; ſo at the leaſt the meaneſt or loweſt Member of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> or Houſe of God, is the <hi>Temple</hi> of God; yea a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Priest, Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. Is it reaſonable therefore to argue from hence, that therefore every tru lively Member of the holy <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath the power of a <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe ſuch titles are in ſome ſenſe applicable unto them?</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50679:12"/>
               <p>§. It follows, <hi>and being joyned thus by mutual aſſent of each perſon, they have power over one another as in all Fraternites, and liberty from Christ to chooſe their Officers, cenſure Offenders, make Canons, and Orders in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials for the Regulating of their affairs.</hi> Be it ſo, yet even then all the power they can lawfully claim, is to aſſemble to Pray, Preach, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Sacraments, which I ſhall not deny them; but as for other powers (except to put them out of that particular Congregation) I know none they have right unto, or that they can endow one another withal, but what muſt neceſſarily in reſpect of good government be ſubordinate to <hi>the more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and greater power of the ſame kind,</hi> which is the <hi>Chriſtian Common-wealth,</hi> which is the <hi>National Christian Church,</hi> the publick power of all Societies being above every ſoul contained in the ſame Fraternities; and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal uſe of that power is to give Laws unto all that are under it; which Laws in ſuch caſe ought to be obeyed, unleſs there be reaſon ſhewed, which may neceſſarily enforce, that the Law of Reaſon or of God doth enjoyn the contrary, becauſe except our private and but probable reſolutions be by the Law of publick determinations over-ruled, we take away all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſociable life in the world. If they will have powers over one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (as in all Fraternities) then they muſt be firſt made a Corporation by ſome more ſupreme Authority, and endowed with powers as all other Fraternities are; for no number of men in any entire rightful Government can give themſelves orders or powers diſtinct and exempt from the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Juriſdiction, theſe muſt be had from the ſupreme eſtabliſhed Power, elſe if inſtead of cenſuring Fornicators or Adulterers to the White Sheer, or Stool of Repentance, they ſhould cenſure or condemn them to the Gallies; or as in the Old Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.10. <hi>to be stoned to death,</hi> I doubt they would not do it <hi>impune,</hi> and yet a Chriſtian Common-wealth, which is a <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> might lawfully enact ſuch a Law. Liberty from Chriſt alone for their demanded powers I know they claim, but <hi>quo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto? non ſum informatus,</hi> eſpecially free and exempt from all ſuperior ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: Texts they can name none that are applicable to ſuch Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but will be much more properly applicable to <hi>National Churches</hi> to govern the whole. As for the power of Cenſures, ſo of the making of Canons and Orders in Circumſtantials for regulating of their affairs, the ſame reaſons hold more ſtrongly for the <hi>National Church,</hi> who (as well as the <hi>Independents</hi>) <hi>profeſs their Independency upon Christ alone, and to be their only Head and Lawgiver,</hi> as beſt knowing how to govern his own houſe. If Independency be ſound doctrine, then if the <hi>Independent,</hi> the <hi>Roman Pontif, the Prelate,</hi> the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> the <hi>Quaker,</hi> and a thouſand more Sects ſhould ſet up each for themſelves, by the ſame doctrine in this or any other Chriſtian Nation, who ſhall reform? they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not all be in the right, and to reform one another is againſt the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Independency, and yet reformation ought to be, and power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be ſeated ſomewhere, either in the Civil Magiſtrate, or in Synods, Councils, &amp;c. the chiefeſt reformations in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> have been by the Kings, and ſupreme Magiſtrates, ſometimes without the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſometimes commanding and compelling them to conſent. So <hi>Aſa</hi> commanding, <hi>That whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael ſhould be put to death, whether ſmall or great, Man, or Woman:</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3, 4.18. and ſo <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.31.32. And ſo indeed all the good Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and if they did not, judgments were denounced againſt them by the Prophers from God, and they were puniſhed; which power is not abrogated, but confirmed by the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>They farther ſay, <hi>As the Church Catholick in General, ſo each parcel of it, each particular Church hath Christ alſo for its head, and in ſuch a union with him, and ſuch exiſtence in him</hi> (even as a Church) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> unto <hi>the Church of the Theſſalonians which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Christ, Grace, &amp;c.</hi> we ſay ſo too; but how this makes for Independency, that is the great queſtion; the Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis and ſtreſs of which verſe lies in theſe words, <hi>viz. which is in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> which ſome think to be a deſcription of the Church of God, to put difference betwixt <hi>Christian Churches</hi> and the Aſſembly of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> which are not in God, but in Idols; not in Chriſt, but in an abſolute God, whom they conceive and worſhip out of the bleſſed Trinity, in the Father and the Son; that is, ſay ſome, in the Faith and Worſhip of the Trinity; ſay others, in bleſſed and heavenly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father and the Son by bond of the Spirit: others think that they do import a kind of <gap reason="foreign">

Take the words in which ſenſe you pleaſe. I do not ſee how they are more applicable to <hi>Independent</hi> than unto other <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> not eſteemed <hi>Independent;</hi> if they contain any other reaſons more favouring <hi>Independent Churches</hi> than others, I muſt confeſs that they are unto me <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> and I gueſs unto them alſo, for that they have not ſpecified any.</p>
               <p>§. I can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> alſo to what follows in the negative, <hi>viz.</hi> [As that <hi>if perſons making up this Body be conſidered distinctly, and as incorporated one with another only, and not in their relation to Chriſt alſo, as one with them, and chief in the midſt of them,</hi> Matt. 18.20. <hi>they are not a compleat Body or ſpiritual Polity.</hi>] For though a million of <hi>Biſhops, Prelats,</hi> or <hi>Clarks,</hi> even the <hi>Popes</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals</hi> aſſiſting, not thus qualified ſhould aſſemble for their own gain, dignities, or juriſdiction, or for any other ſiniſter end, or if their conſultations ſhould be managed by ſuperior power or faction (as not long ſince in that pack'd brib'd <hi>Conventicle at Trent Independently</hi> in their eſteem, made up of Titulars and Pentioners and Biſhops) they have no like intereſt in the former promiſe. For any Church viſible or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, whoſe Individuals are not ſo qualified, the greater part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for number, or more principal Authority, may be <hi>Infideles, aut Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici occulti, Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Atheists</hi> in heart: for though their perſons and profeſſion of their Faith may be to us mortals viſible, yet the ſincerity of their hearts and faith is to us inviſible.</p>
               <p>And I can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> alſo to ſome part of the affirmative, which follows, <hi>viz. That we as well as they do profeſs our dependency alſo to be upon Chriſt alone, for the government and management of this his Kingdom; and thus being dependent upon Christ our only Lawgiver,</hi> James 4.12. <hi>who is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father,</hi> and beſt knoweth how to govern his own houſe. But I cannot from hence conclude them Independent as they do, in reſpect to the Authority or Soveraignty of any other <hi>Perſon, Church, Synod,</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> whatſoever: there is <hi>modus in rebus,</hi> difference between ſtaring and ſtark mad, between ſubmitting to Superiors, as if they were <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>had dominion of our Faith;</hi> and to our Superiors repreſentative, making whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Laws for order and good government only, and thoſe not excluſive our conſent neither, virtually at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſay that this alſo may be true in ſome part, as in Subſtantials, though not in Circumſtantials: As if Authority ſhould command the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50679:13"/>of the Euchariſt which was inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf in the days of his fleſh (and is of ſo myſterious and ſo ſpiritual a nature, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall add or diminiſh from it will be in danger of the menace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.18, 19.) in one kind only (as our holy Father at <hi>Rome</hi> doth) when as Chriſt commanded to be given and received in both kinds, or ſhould command ſervice in an unknown tongue contrary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preſcript, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſuch Canons, ſuch Commands may come within the verge of the <hi>Statutes of Omri</hi> indeed and conſequently, no obligation on any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Perſon</hi> to ſubmit thereunto: but this holds not in innocent Circumſtantials. Therefore to quote <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.16. to me ſeems very ſtrange: as if there were no difference between our Canons and the <hi>Statutes of Omri, who did worſe than all that were before him, walking in all the ways of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.25, 26, <hi>who did ſin, and made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>K.</hi> 14.16. as if no difference between his <hi>Priests, who conſecrated whoever would, even the loweſt of the People, Priests of the high places;</hi> and our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Priests, Priests</hi> of the moſt <hi>high God,</hi> as if no difference between <hi>Jeroboams Calves</hi> and <hi>our ſervice,</hi> but both muſt be alike Idolatrous; this is hard. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; only the 6. of <hi>Mich.</hi> 16. will not warrant the Aſſertion as to us what ever it may do at <hi>Rome;</hi> they muſt if they can bring better proofs, the Text is not in the leaſt applicable to our Diſcipline and Polity; this is plainly to pervert Scripture, and comes within the verge of the <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>§. Thoſe famous <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Corinth, Smirna, &amp;c.</hi> were of old <hi>quaſi National Churches,</hi> or at leaſt inſtead of them <hi>pro tempore;</hi> for that then, and in thoſe days there were no <hi>National Churches,</hi> no <hi>Kings,</hi> or Common-wealth Nurſing-Fathers of the <hi>Church;</hi> ſo that when Religion was planted in chief Cities theſe Cities (wherein no doubt were ſeveral Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) were as it were the Mother and chief <hi>Churches,</hi> and in all probability the <hi>minor Churches</hi> in the Suburbs and Villages next adjacent unto ſuch <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> had more eſpecially recourſe for advice unto the next <hi>Metropolitan</hi> or more ample Church, who had all the powers rightfully belonging to a <hi>Compleat Church.</hi> But it cannot demonſtratively be made out that every Pariſh or Congregation in thoſe days was a <hi>Plenipotentiary Church</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, and that they were Independent in their ſenſe: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in thoſe famous <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Laodicea, &amp;c.</hi> as Independent they cannot, for that as each of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> had many Presbyters, ſo conſequently they had many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet the Title of <hi>Church</hi> was attributed only to each <hi>Church</hi> in general, and to the <hi>Angel</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> as chief Governor thereof, and not to every particular Presbyter, and his gathered Congregation there;<note place="margin">Nero quaeſitiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis poenis affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit quos profla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitia inviſos vulgus Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos appellabat.

What ſhould here follow concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50679:14"/>the power of the Civil Magiſtrate, ſhall be referred to a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
               <p>§. A more plauſible Argument for <hi>Independency,</hi> and unobſerved by any that I have yet read, is, <hi>viz.</hi> that when Chriſt ſent his twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi> two by two into ſeveral Coaſts to preach his Goſpel, and to teach all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was not that the <hi>Churches</hi> gathered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſubject unto the Government or Inſpection of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or unto the <hi>Churches</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by him: nor that the Churches gathered by St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the Judicature of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Churches gathered by him; and ſo of all the other <hi>Apostles:</hi> but every <hi>Apostle</hi> and his gathered <hi>Church</hi> had a right of Eccleſiaſtical Government intrinſick within it ſelf, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on any of the other <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor reſponſible for their Actions to any other <hi>Church, Perſon,</hi> or <hi>Officers:</hi> and that divers of the <hi>Apostles</hi> met in <hi>Council at Jeruſalem</hi> to ſettle ſome urgent things then controverted, and not then agreed on, was prudential only, and voluntary, not eſſential, compulſory or obligatory, yet a practice very worthy of Imitation.</p>
               <p>§. That the <hi>Apostles</hi> and other <hi>Ambaſſadors of Christ</hi> were ſo ſent, and that they and their Congregations were independent in point of Diſcipline and Judicature one of the other, is not denied by any Proteſtant Divines that I know of, and it is or ought to be as little gain-ſaid that it could not then be otherwiſe. And why? Chriſt knew that the Meſſengers which he ſent to gather a People to himſelf out of <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Inſidels, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by perſwaſive means only, were to build up his <hi>Church</hi> within the Boſom of Kingdoms, which were and would continue avowed Enemies to his Goſpel every where for a long time then to come. And therefore he gave them ſuch Doctrines and ſuch Commiſſions for Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline as they might any where publiſh, and exerciſe in a quiet, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, the Subjects of no Common-wealth being any where therein concerned in goods or perſon, by vertue of that ſpiritual regiment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Chriſtian Religion once embraced, did make them lyable. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if they had not a Government within themſelves, they could have none at all concerning Chriſtian Religion: For Princes and all Nations were then profeſſed and bitter enemies to Chriſtian Religion, which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did alſo extend it ſelf unto ſmall matters, even ſuch as were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impleadable and remediable in the Civil Courts and Judicatures of the Kingdome or State though heatheniſh, wherein and under whom they lived as Subjects, <hi>Dare any of you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, having a matter against another go to law before the unjust, and not before the Saints; do ye not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world? and if the world ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. So that upon the whole matter the Sum total of Religion that Chriſt committed to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and they to their ſucceſſors, conſiſted in the Doctrin and Diſcipline thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> to preach him and him crucified, and to perſwade others to become Chriſtians through the belief of <hi>one Lord, one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> and when once admitted by the door of Baptiſm into the <hi>Christian Church</hi> then to become and to be accounted Members of the viſible Church Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>As for Diſcipine, that concerns moral righteouſneſs and honeſty of life, and their contraries unrighteouſneſs, and diſhoneſty; and therefore Chriſt gave them this General Precept, <hi>viz. to love one another, even our neighbours as our ſelves;</hi> and if any did tranſgreſs the Vertues and Laws which belong unto moral righteouſneſs, and honeſty of life, which are not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50679:14"/>proper and peculiar unto Chriſtian men as Chriſtians, but as Men) what then? the tranſgreſſors were firſt privatly to be admoniſhed if the offence were private; <hi>thoſe that ſinned openly were to be rebuked openly;</hi> if they did not then repent and amend, <hi>then to be admoniſhed by two or three;</hi> if ſtill they remained incorrigible, then to acquaint that <hi>Congregation of Chriſtian Brethren,</hi> of which they were <hi>Members,</hi> and if ſtill they continued refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory after private and publick Admonitions, Warnings, and Prayers, then not to own them as <hi>Brethren, nor to keep company with them, with ſuch, no, not to eat with them,</hi> and in the end to purſue them as if <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> as not being worthy of the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> which they had put on, they not living to the <hi>adorning,</hi> but to the ſhame of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And this is the ſum of the whol Government or Diſcipline, which Chriſt after the death of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (who having gifts extraordinary, had alſo powers extraordinary, which died with them) left to his <hi>Church</hi> for ought appears by any Scripture extant. And what need of more? For if the Miniſters of the <hi>everlasting Goſpel</hi> have liberty to <hi>Inſtruct, break Bread, Baptize,</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> the Civil Chriſtian Magiſtrat hath ſufficient power by Gods own Ordinance to order all the reſt.</p>
               <p>§. To me indeed it ſeems marvelous, nay monſtrous, that out of ſo plain; ſo intelligible, ſo eaſily practicable directions for the Government of <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> that ſo various, ſo meerly wordly and pompous, nay imperious and impious <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Church Government,</hi> ſhould be drawn into uſe, as have been hundreds of years practiſed both in the Eaſtern and Weſtern Empires, and all held forth to be according to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when in truth they all differ from the true <hi>Goſpel</hi> Diſcipline as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, they being all degenerated into meer <hi>worldly forms</hi> ſet up for meer worldly ſelf-ends and intereſts.</p>
               <p>If any man can more plainly make out any other form from the Goſpel, it would be a favour, my ſelf I muſt confeſs to be <hi>Impar Negotio,</hi> it is paſt my underſtanding. Indeed to me it ſeems wonderful, whilſt I conſider that though Hiſtories are ful and plain how and when the ſeveral forms crept in, and got Accruments partly by the ſupineneſs and negligence of the Brethren of their own Rights and Priviledges, partly by the craft and ſubtlety of proud, covetous and ambitious Clergy; and partly by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of Princes, who not willing to trouble themſelves with the care of Religion devolved it upon others, that they ſhould yet endeavour to keep us hoodwinkt, though they know that our eyes are now open. If there be any other Goſpel-form of Government, let it plainly appear without offering violence to any Texts of Scripture; if not, why ſhould we be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than Chriſt our Head and Lawgiver? <hi>God</hi> only is <hi>truth,</hi> and all men are ſubject to errors, what remains? but that all his Servants, and more eſpecially the Prieſts of the moſt high God (whoſe lips above others ſhould more eſpecially preſerve knowledg) do abandon humane errors and falſ ſuperſtructures, and keep the <hi>praecepts of God only,</hi> that they may <hi>remain stedfaſt in the truth only.</hi>

Some are of opinion that there is no need at all of any Eccleſiaſtical Government as diſtinct from the Civil if Chriſtian and Orthodox; and if there be, that yet the <hi>Body of the Church</hi> is to govern it ſelf, and not the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> the <hi>Body:</hi> they are to teach them their duty, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſionary, coercive, and executive power is <hi>ſeated in the Body, and not in the Pope or Presbyter.</hi> I know the grand objection againſt <hi>Independency</hi> is, that it is deſtructive to Government, and tends to <hi>Anarchy;</hi> a meer ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50679:15"/>rather than a juſt objection, for if rightly conſidered, it would be found the leaſt <hi>Chagreen</hi> to any Civil Government of any Eccleſiaſtical Government at this very day in uſe in any Nation; and if not miſtaken, I have <hi>Christ</hi> (who was the Wiſdom of the Father) and his <hi>Apostles</hi> to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy me herein: For the Government that is herein ſtated may be exerciſed under any Government how averſe ſoever to Chriſtianity it ſelf without claſhing or interfeering therewith. And if <hi>Christ</hi> left no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as for certain he did not,) why ſhould we pretend to be wiſer than <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf?

               <p>Al this while the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their Succeſſors were <hi>independent one of the other, and ſo were their ſeveral and ſelect gathered Congregations.</hi> The like may be as truly verified of the ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> gathered in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages, and indeed throughout al <hi>Palestine.</hi> The Perſecution increaſing 19 <hi>Tiberii, Paul</hi> himſelf being as it were <hi>Signiſer</hi> or <hi>Inquiſitor Haereticorum,</hi> great cruelty being uſed towards the Chriſtians, cauſed the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and ſome of their Diſciples to diſpoſe of themſelves into neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations (whereby the great wiſdom and counſel of God was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that thereby the propagation of the Goſpel became more univerſally ſpread) yet ſo that ſome of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were always at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the principal Seat of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> always ready to confirm and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Brethren under their Perſecutions; and though they made often excurſions from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into other Regions, yet they many times returned thither again; <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf returned thither five times after his converſion, from whence he was carried priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> where though detained <hi>two years a priſoner, yet preached the Goſpel,</hi> even then and there.</p>

                  <hi>the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and great Grace was upon them all,</hi> 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 31.32.33. and accordingly the <hi>manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man, to profit withal, to one the Word of Wiſdome, to another the Word of Knowledge, to another faith</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all by the ſame Spirit.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.8. and all theſe for the <hi>edifying of the Body of Christ</hi> 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 12, <hi>For though the Body be one, yet hath it many Members, and all the Members of that one Body being many, are one Body, whereof Chriſt is the head,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
               <p>In the viſible Government of the <hi>Church, Christ</hi> appointed and inſtituted a Prieſthood (in which likewiſe it is diſſimilar to all temporal Governments) which <hi>quodam ſenſuis Independent</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> though touching the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Authority to the Perſon, it is elective and depending of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> under this <hi>Priesthood</hi> is comprehended <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbiters,</hi> now what their Authority and Powers are, <hi>vide</hi> their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. <hi>go teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and loe I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, unto the end of the world:</hi> other Powers beſides theſe, and laying on of hands, eſpecially coercive, I know none derived unto them by any text of Scripture.</p>

But of this more fully here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>§. Though the <hi>Congregational</hi> men have not fully modelled out unto us the Platform of their Government and Diſcipline as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have done, yet in general they do affirm,<note place="margin">Independency and Church-Government.</note> 
                  <hi>that to each gathered Church Chriſt hath given all Power and Authority requiſite unto that Order and Diſcipline, which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for them to obſerve, and to execute the ſame with Commands and Rules as before.</hi> And negatively <hi>that there is not instituted by Christ any perſon or Church more extenſive or Catholick entruſted with Power over other Churches, and that each particular Church conſiſts of Officers, and Members, which Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers they call Brethren, and the Officers they stile</hi> Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, <hi>and</hi> Deacons, <hi>and that there are no stated Synods in a fixed combination of Churches, nor any Synods appointed by Christ in any way of ſub-ordination to one another, nor no one Church to have Power of Cenſures, but of inſpection only over other Churches, and Members thereof that Counſel and Advice might mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually be communicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was ſo in the days of the Apoſtles and continued ſo for ſome Generations after, every Individual <hi>gathered Church,</hi> every Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie (as it is natural to all Societies as well Chriſtian as Civil) governing it ſelf by its own Laws and Conſtitutions, whithout being obliged to any other ſuperintendency, hapily is ſo manifeſt that it would not be gainſaid: But when the <hi>Church</hi> became planted and ſpread its Branches, and took root in divers Nations, and whole Common-wealths became Chriſtian, and <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> and other Civil <hi>Governments</hi> became <hi>Nurſing-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> then of neceſſity for the quiet ſtate of the whole, the caſe came to be altered, it being then impoſſible that every individual Member or Brother of any Chriſtian Kingdom or Common-wealth, ſhould perſonally meet to make Laws and Orders for the better reglement of the whole, as they did whilſt the Churches were in ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, or Cities in a Jewiſh or Gentile State. And yet all Laws are preſumed to be made by univerſal and common conſent, in which regard the <hi>Churches</hi> have been enforced to have as well <hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>Bodies</hi> Politick <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> and in as much when partly by the Supineneſs and inadvertency of the Brethren without foreſight of any Peril, or Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their Rights, and Powers by the Clergy, and partly by the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and uſurpation of the then degenerating Clergy, deſigning to advance themſelves by ingroſſing <hi>all Powers and Revenues</hi> to themſelves, not by any right derived to them by any Goſpel precept, the practiſe and cuſtome (injuriouſly enough to the <hi>Laity</hi> and conſequently to the <hi>Church of God</hi> in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50679:18"/>the trueſt ſence) began ſoon to admit none but <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Church men</hi> only, as Members of the Body eccleſiaſtick, or <hi>Church repreſentative.</hi> The <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> hath by ſuch their wiles been in a manner appropriated and monopolized to the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Church-men only,</hi> when in truth the <hi>Church</hi> in its trueſt and Scripture ſence conſiſting of <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> can have no repreſentative of both (which only makes the <hi>Church</hi> compleat) except both have their peculiar Repreſentatives in <hi>Councils, Synods, Convocations,</hi> &amp;c. whether <hi>Provincial, National,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> This Doctrine (of which more hereafter) though never ſo demonſtrable and obvious to every underſtanding, was ſo bitter a Pill, that it could by no means be ſwallowed at <hi>Trent,</hi> and therefore in the Conſults and Diſcourſes concerning the very title of that Council (concerning which there were very great Debates and Diſputes) the <hi>Biſhop of Feltre,</hi> would not have it Chriſtened <hi>Ecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>general,</hi> leaſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould from thence argumentize that ſome of every Order of the univerſal <hi>Church</hi> ought to be preſent, which becauſe it conſiſts of Clergy and Laity, it cannot intirely and compleatly be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, if the Laity be excluded: But on the contrary the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> did as erroneouſly as magiſterially affirm, that the <hi>Laicks</hi> were moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the <hi>Church,</hi> and that for that very reaſon it was very requiſite to uſe the title that the Synod repreſenteth the <hi>Church univerſal,</hi> to make the <hi>Laity</hi> be underſtood that they are not the <hi>Church,</hi> but ought to hearken unto and obey the <hi>Church,</hi> which in Romiſh dialect is nought elſe but the Pope, by which it is apparent, that if packt Synods canonize us out of the <hi>Church</hi> to day, they may canonize us out of our Chriſtian names to morrow, and out of our Chriſtianity the next day. But of this more hereafter when the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> ſhall be more fully diſcourſed.</p>
               <p>Yet by the favour of the great <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>St. Mark,</hi> nay by the favour of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, in the <hi>beginning it was no ſo,</hi> for in the Council of the Apoſtles, and a more early and more Authentick could not be, and which ought to be a Rule and Pattern, the decree was not made by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> alone, but the Epiſtle was entituled with the names of the 3 degrees aſſiſting in that Congregation, viz. <hi>Apoſtles, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brothers,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (eſteemed and ſtiled by the Romaniſts <hi>Princeps Apoſtolorum</hi>) by the Popes good leave was included in the firſt, <hi>without Prerogative</hi> (though not always <hi>Sans reprimand</hi>) by which it is apparent, that the aſſembling of a <hi>whole Church</hi> to handle the Name of God, the Diſputes about Doctrine and Diſcipline is a thing moſt profitable, uſed by the Holy Apoſtles in the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> and the 7 <hi>Deacons,</hi> with which the <hi>Dioceſan Councils</hi> have great reſemblance. But of the meeting of Chriſtians from many remote places to conſult together the forementioned place, 15. <hi>Act.</hi> is a famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnab as,</hi> with others of <hi>Syria,</hi> met with the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> and other Diſciples in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were aſſembled about the queſtion of keeping the Law.</p>
               <p>By all which it is manifeſt, that in the beginning of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> were <hi>Democratically Governed</hi> by a kind of <hi>Common Council,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and others do confeſs; but as the Eccleſiaſticks by inſenſible gradations got Reputation and Power, ſo they endeavoured a <hi>Monarchical Regiment,</hi> which in tract of time they inſtituted and got to be eſtabliſhed, giving all the <hi>Superintendency</hi> to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whom all Orders of the <hi>Church</hi> did obey. The neighbouring <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whoſe Churches were under one juriſdiction, had likewiſe their commerce and communion, and did govern themſelves alſo as it were in common by Synods, attributing much to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the moſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50679:18"/>Principal City, ordaining him as it were the Head or Governour of that Body, and in proceſs of time, by a more ample communion, which all the Provinces of one Jurisdiction or larger Government held together, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the City where the Prince did reſide, gained a kind of Superiority or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priority by cuſtom, not by any right. The more chief Juriſdictions were the imperial City of <hi>Rome</hi> with its neighbouring Cities, <hi>Alexandria</hi> which governed <hi>Aegypt, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis, Antioch,</hi> for <hi>Syria,</hi> and other Provinces of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> There were other leſſer Juriſdictions, wherein the ſame was obſerved. This Government being at firſt meerly prudential, introduced and approved only by Cuſtom, was afterwards eſtabliſhed by the firſt Council of <hi>Nice, Can.</hi> 6. under <hi>Constantine,</hi> and ordained by a Canon that it ſhould continue: yet withal it did ordain, that thoſe many Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preheminences which the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had, ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. yet ſo that nothing ſhould be taken from the dignity of the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> then <hi>Biſhop of Caeſaria.</hi> This Government which hath been ever held in all the Churches of the <hi>East,</hi> was altered in the <hi>Latine,</hi> not without great endeavours to make all other <hi>Churches</hi> ſtoop to the <hi>Lure,</hi> and ſubmit to the Will and Pleaſure of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that it pleaſed God to give peace to the Chriſtians, and that the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> received the <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> there then happening more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in Doctrine and Diſcipline, which did diſturb the publick Peace and quiet, <hi>another ſort of Epiſcopal Aſſemblies had beginning,</hi> congregated by <hi>Princes,</hi> or their <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> to remedy their troubles, theſe <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> were guided, and governed by thoſe Princes and Magiſtrates, yet ſo, that the deciſion of the principal matters, for which the Council was congregat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was left to the <hi>common opinion of the Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the <hi>Eastern and Western Empires</hi> were divided, there remained ſtill in the Weſt, ſome Marks of the Antient Councils, and many were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> under the Poſterity of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and not a few in <hi>Spain,</hi> under the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Gothes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Princes</hi> being abſolutely debarred, to intermeddle in Eccleſiaſtical matters, that kind of Council grew in diſuſe, and that alone remained which was called by the Eccleſiaſticks themſelves, the <hi>Convocation</hi> of which <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> was almoſt wholly ingroſſed and uſurped by the <hi>Pope,</hi> by intruding and ſending his <hi>Legats</hi> to be <hi>Preſidents,</hi> whereſoever he heard there was a Treaty to hold a Council. And after a certain time he took the power to himſelf, which the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> uſed, to convocate a <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>whole Empire,</hi> and to be <hi>Preſident</hi> himſelf, if preſent, if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſend <hi>Legates</hi> to be <hi>Preſidents.</hi> But a little more than one Age being paſt, it was very neceſſary, that every Nation ſhould Aſſemble by it ſelf, and reſolve according to the Number of Voices, and that the general deciſion ſhould be eſtabliſhed, not by the ſuffrages of particular men, but by the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the voices of the Nations, ſo it was obſerved in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> which uſe as it is good where the Government is free, as it was when the world had no <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo it ill befits the <hi>Pope,</hi> who deſires all <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> to be ſubject to him.</p>
               <p>§. Having thus ſummarily given a ſhort proſpect of the ſtate of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the firſt and purer times, and how in ſucceeding times it came by degrees to be altered, I proceed and ſay again to the Independents, that be it as they would have it, that the <hi>gathered Churches</hi> by one <hi>Apoſtle</hi> were not ſubject to the inſpection and ſubordination of an other, or of all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (the cauſe of ſuch Independency being then and in them reaſonable,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50679:19"/>for that each <hi>Apostle</hi> was guided by an infallible Spirit, and ſo not abſolutely neceſſary, and yet even in their times it was thought fit to call a <hi>Council</hi> for ſetling of ſome differences) yet it doth not therefore follow, nor cannot demonſtratively be proved, that every <hi>individual Pastor,</hi> after the times of the Apoſtles, had their ſelect Congregations ſeperate and diſtinct from others, or that thoſe Congregations were Independent, free and exempt from all inſpection, or ſuperintendency of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or other <hi>Presbiters.</hi> The conjectures and probabilities (and they have no Arguments of an other nature) ſeem ſtrong for the contrary, for Religion did firſt take place in Cities, which had their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Colledges,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> whom firſt the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their Deligats the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> did both ordain and govern, ſuch were the <hi>Colledges</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Rome, Corinth,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the reſt where the Apoſtles are known to have planted our Faith and Religion. Now Religion in thoſe days and places, and the cure of Souls, was their general charge in common, over all that were about them, neither had any one Presbyter, for ought that appears by any eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, his ſeveral cure or ſeperate title diſtinct, and apart until the diviſion of Pariſhes, which was firſt made by the <hi>People,</hi> when a certain number of Inhabitants having received the true Faith, built a <hi>Temple</hi> for the exerciſing of their Religion, hired a Prieſt, and did conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a <hi>Church,</hi> which by them was called a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and when the number was increaſed if one <hi>Church,</hi> and Prieſt were not ſufficient, they who were moſt remote did build another, and ſit themſelves better. And in proceſs of time for the ſake of good Order and concord, cuſtom began to have the <hi>Biſhops conſent</hi> alſo, and<note n="†" place="margin">Hic Titulos in urbe Roma diviſit pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteris.</note> 
                  <hi>Evaristus Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 112. began to aſſign precincts to ever <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Title,</hi> which the Chriſtians held, and to appoint unto each Presbyter a certain compaſs whereof himſelf ſhould take charge alone: him<note n="†" place="margin">Hic Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris eccleſias di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſit coemite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria parochias &amp; dio diaeceſes conſtituit.</note>

                  <hi>Honorius</hi> alſo being then <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>) about the year 636. became divided in like manner, and have ſo continued ever ſince. Other diſtinction of the <hi>Churches</hi> there doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any in the Writings of the <hi>Apostles</hi> ſave thoſe according to Cities only 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 36.1. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 20. wherein they planted the Goſpel of Chriſt, and erected eccleſiaſtical Colledges of Presbyters and Deacons ordained, by the Apoſtles to exerciſe eccleſiaſtical functions, <hi>promiſcuouſly and at large,</hi> till the ſaid <hi>Evariſtus</hi> did about 100 <hi>years</hi> after Chriſt diſtinguiſh the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> into Pariſhes, tying each one to his proper ſtation, ſo that indeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite care of ſouls, and indefinite ordination do approach nearer the Apoſtles times and example. And preſcription for the congregational way may be more juſtly grounded on the example of the People (who are the Brethren, who are the <hi>Church</hi>) and of <hi>Evariſtus</hi> then of any Apoſtle of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover this the Independents will hardly evade, each <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days had many Presbyters that laboured in the Word, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do plainly witneſs it. In the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.23. of <hi>Antioch,</hi> 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>of whom,</hi> 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.29. of <hi>Phillippi,</hi> 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. of other Churches the like is affirmed, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>James</hi> 5.14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. Now if each <hi>Church</hi> had more Presbiters and Paſtors than one in the days of the <hi>Apostles</hi> (as it is manifeſt they had) then can it be hardly made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50679:19"/>out by right reaſon, that every individual <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pastor</hi> had his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and circumſcribed gathered <hi>Church</hi> free of all ſubordination, they ſeem contradictory in themſelves. On the contrary, in the more pure times no man was ever ordained for ſome hundred of years, to whom there was not appointed both his proper and ſpecial Office and Charge, and Antiquity knew no diſtinction between Ordination and Benefice, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining was the ſame thing as to give an Office, and the right of having ones livelyhood from the common goods of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. The Independents do farther aver for their own juſtification, and that moſt truly, that it is a thing natural, that all free and <hi>Independent Societies</hi> ſhould themſelves make their own Laws (of which ſort they take their <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Churches</hi> to be) which is the thing queſtioned and denyed, and ſay, they are not Independent for the reaſons ſhewed. But be it ſo yet then it is averred, that it is as true and as natural, that the Legiſlative-Chriſtian-Power ſhould and doth belong to the whole (<hi>England</hi> for example) and not to any certain Pariſh, City or Country, as to <hi>London, York,</hi> &amp;c. of a Politick Body, though happily ſome one part may have a greater ſhare therein than ſome others. And as this right doth naturally belong to a Commonwealth, ſo it muſt needs belong to the <hi>Church</hi> of God, which in the trueſt underſtanding is the Commonwealth, if Chriſtian, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pele thereof do publickly embrace the true Religion. As this very thing doth make it the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo the whole <hi>England,</hi> not any certain part (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Weſtminster</hi> or at <hi>York</hi>) hath the power of making Laws, and conſtitutions eccleſiaſtical. A Law is the deed of the whole body politick, whereof, if the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be any part, then is the Law even their own deed alſo, as being made by the repreſentatives of the whole wherein they are included, as having their moſt proper repreſentatives in our <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> the undoubted Legiſlative Power of this Kingdom. And is it reaſonable in things of this nature and conſequence, to give men audience, pleading for the overthrow of that which (as it were) their own very deed hath ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Laws that have been approved both in <hi>Church</hi> and State may be, no man doubteth, again repealed, and to that end alſo diſputed againſt by the ſame Authority: But this moſt properly is when the whole doth deliberate what Laws each part ſhall obſerve, and not when a few run counter the Laws which the whole hath made in a full and free Parliament and lawfull Convocation. Be it, that ſome reaſons induce ſome perſons to be otherwiſe minded, if thoſe reaſons be demonſtrative and abſolutely neceſſary, ſuch I confeſs diſcharge conſciences, and ſetteth them at full liberty; but if proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only, what thing was there ever ſet down ſo agreeable to ſound reaſon, but ſome probable ſhew againſt it may be made: Is it meet that when <hi>Acts of Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> have been publickly received, and long practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that general obedience thereunto ſhould ceaſe to be exacted, in caſe ſome few led by ſome probable conceits, ſhould make open proteſtation of their diſſatisfaction. Certainly in ſuch caſes they are obliged to ſuſpend their judgments, for that in otherwiſe doing they offend againſt God by troubling his <hi>Church</hi> without any juſt or neceſſary cauſe.</p>
               <p>For until the Civil Chriſtian Magiſtrate (whoſe power it is that I contend for) doth otherwiſe order and determine, obedience is to be given to the Laws Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, if not contrary to the word of God. <hi>Turpis est pars quae univerſo non congruit ſuo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which premiſes, and of what will follow more particularly, I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50679:20"/>ſhall take the liberty to aſſert and conclude, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> in general is undeniably <hi>Independent,</hi> and hath intrinſick power within it ſelf without any forraign aid or dependency, or any ſubordination to any other Perſon, <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> to govern it ſelf, and that every <hi>Pariſh</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation thereof, is not <hi>ſo Independent;</hi> but rather that every particular doth depend upon the whole, for that all ought to govern the whole, and every particular thereof, and every one ought to imploy himſelf moſt in that which is moſt particularly recommended to him, and that the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and of all other <hi>National Churches</hi> is the Legiſlative Power thereof, and that the <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>chief Governor</hi> thereof according to the conſtituted Laws and Canons thereof.</p>
               <p>§. And this Legiſlative Power hath lawful Authority to conſtitute all Qualifications unto all publick Eccleſiaſtical preferments, ſo that they which will not ſubmit to ſuch qualifications, ſhall be uncapable of ſuch publick Benefices and Preferments. But neither this nor <hi>any other Power throughout the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, hath any lawful Authority to forbid the gathering of Churches or ſtop the mouths of any Biſhop or Presbyter to preach the Goſpel, nor to forbid the ſolemn aſſembling together of the Saints, or of the Brethren,</hi> according to their ſeveral Commiſſions, <hi>viz. go teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. <hi>And let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works, not forſaking the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is but exhort one another</hi> 10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 24.25. if this had not been good Doctrine, and practiſed even by Chriſt himſelf, his Apoſtles, and their followers (maugre all the Interdicts of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile States</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> curſed Tyrants) the Goſpel had never been ſpread. In ſuch Caſes where commands of Governments are contrary to commands of God, it is undoubtedly <hi>better to obey God than Man.</hi> I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for that though in truth it the be elder Brother unto <hi>Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by 1600 <hi>years,</hi> yet it ſeems unto moſt to be but my <hi>Lord Musſhrome,</hi> and of yeſterdays extract, and very little underſtood by Vulgar Capacities. In the Treaty whereof I have taken occaſion in ſome meaſure to trace both the wayes of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the wiles of the <hi>Church-Men</hi> from its very Infancy, and ſhall purſue it farther when I come to ſhew what, and who are meant by the term <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that if poſſible the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may be made eaſie and intelligible to every underſtanding. Plain dealing is beſt, and <hi>truth</hi> (like beauty) is moſt beautiful, when ſtark naked, ſtript of all paints, and School-tricks and Gloſſes, by which truth is more often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and defaced, than brought unto light in its pure and natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>§. I ſhall now proceed and ſay ſomething of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, but ſhall not meddle with their Model at all, it being done, and done to my hand, it hangs on every Hedg, and is decyphered and refelled in an Iliad of Pamphlets, and is as perfectly diſliked and diſguſted as known, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think we may bid them defiance, ſet it up, and eſtabliſh it if they can, eſpecially if <hi>excommunication</hi> the main prop and pillar thereof were taken away, without which it muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground, and which is of no uſe in any Chriſtian State, and which in truth is a <hi>nemo ſcit</hi> utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Scripture it ſelf, as now uſed eſpecially.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo fond are they of it, and ſo wedded unto it, and ſuch is the ſelfiſhneſs of the Clergy, of all perſwaſions, and ſo great a Biaſs is their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and love of domination, that the very thought of parting with it, doth cut them to the heart, and it cannot be got from them without rending and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50679:20"/>tearing, as if it were as perverſe as an unclean ſpirit, and though in truth, it makes no return, conſiderable unto any of them; but what redounds unto their dishonour and reproach. I ſhall only ſhew ſome of their tenets and practiſes, by which you may the better judge of them, and I ſhall not go far to fetch them, and declare that now to erect and eſtabliſh that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here or in any other Chriſtian Common-wealth, were to erect <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> and then in ſhort proceſs of time, upon every difference and diſpute as it happened in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> 1610. where <hi>Father Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldo</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> being demanded by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> for a certain opinion concerning <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and from that Inquiſition the proceſs being ſent to <hi>Breſſia</hi> where the Father was, the Inquiſition at <hi>Breſſia,</hi> proceeded in the Cauſe without the Civil Aſſiſtants, and anſwered them not without a deſign to cajole the Civil Magiſtrate out of his juſt right, by a nice diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ought not to aſſiſt, but only in cauſes which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at the proper Tribunal, but not when the Denuntiation was given at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo in a very ſhort time, as it is poſſible, ſo it is very probable that both the Independent and Presbyterian Government would incroach, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench on the Civil Powers (ſo natural is it for every power to incroach upon another) and either joſtle it quite out of doors, or make the Civil ſubſervient to the eccleſiaſtical Power, the ſad effects of which hath been manifeſted in <hi>Scotland</hi> already where the Presbytery, when they will ſpeak out plainly, claim to be coordinate at leaſt with the Civil Juriſdiction, and if we conſult their practiſes, we ſhall find them <hi>Paramount.</hi>

               <p>§. According to <hi>Sa.

               <p>Upon the return of <hi>Angus Arrol</hi> and <hi>Huntley,</hi> Popiſh Lords Fugitives for ſome Rebellious deſigns into <hi>Scotland,</hi> Anno. 1596. <hi>K. I.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention meeting in <hi>August</hi> at <hi>Falkland,</hi> intended to ſhew ſome favour to them, which being ratified at another convention of the States, at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling,</hi> in <hi>Septemb.</hi> the Church forſooth took pet at it, and thereupon entred into a Combination to croſs and prevent it. <hi>K. J.</hi> for the better preſervation of his Realm in peace and ſetled quietneſs, conſulted with much kindneſs, Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> as one for whom the King had a particular kindneſs and the moſt leading man amongſt them, who was very willing that <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arrol</hi> ſhould return on the conditions propoſed, but by no means would admit that <hi>Huntley</hi> ſhould return, though he marryed the Kings Couſin, whom he accounted as his own Daughter, and offered to ſatisfie the <hi>Church</hi> and fulfil the conditions required, and one who had the greateſt power amongſt them, and therefore his Intereſt moſt likely to do the K. moſt ſervice, or moſt prejudice, whereupon <hi>Bruce</hi> moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently replyed, I ſee Sir that your reſolution is to take <hi>Huntly</hi> into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which if you do, I will oppoſe, and you ſhall chooſe whether you will loſe <hi>Huntley</hi> or me, for us both you cannot keep: There's your <hi>Presbiter</hi> in his right Colours!</p>
               <p>This done the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (which Stile they moſt wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſume and monopolize to themſelves only, as if the <hi>King his Council</hi> and Parliament, I might ſay the meaneſt of their Congregations were not as much of the <hi>Church</hi> as themſelves) aſſembled at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where they ordained to acquaint all the Presbiteries, with what had been done and paſſed, finding great fault with the Conditions granted to <hi>Huntly,</hi> and the reſt by the King and the Conventions, as bringing a manifeſt hazard both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and therefore was deſired to inform their flocks, and both by publick Doctrine, and private Conference, to ſtir up the Country people, to apprehend the danger, to be in readineſs, to reſiſt the ſame. Oh brave <hi>Sheba</hi>'s! Trumpeters of Sedition and Commotion, a ſpeedy way to ſet a whole Kingdom againſt the King in a trice; they proceeded yet farther by proclaiming a day of Humiliation through the whole Country, to be on the firſt Sunday (mark that) in <hi>December,</hi> that in <hi>Nomine Domini,</hi> they might with the better grace <hi>faſt for ſtrife, and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of Wickedneſs,</hi> and the cauſe aſſigned, was the return of the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Lords, whereby danger was threatned to Religion (moſtly made a Dequoy, to intice heady and highminded men, and deſpiſers of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not modeled by themſelves to Rebellion) and therefore the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries ſhould call before them their Entertainers, Reſetters, and ſuch as keep company with them, and proceed ſummarily with the <hi>cenſures</hi> of the <hi>Church, una citatione quia periclitatur ſalus eccleſiae &amp; Reipublicae.</hi> I wonder where this <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Power is to be found, that they aſſumed this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to Cite, Summon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any for cauſes of Rebellion, or <hi>cenſure</hi> by <hi>excommunication:</hi> A meer device of their own, which they can never make clearly out, either what it is, or of what extent, or if there be any ſuch thing, that they only have power to execute it, or that they can delegate it.</p>
               <p>Nor reſted they here, but ordained that a number of Commiſſioners ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of all the quarters of the Country, ſhould reſide at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to receive advertiſements, as ſhould be ſent from other places, and take advice upon the moſt expedient in every caſe and in every buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that occurred, by direction of this Council, which by a new name, was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50679:21"/>now forſooth called the <hi>Council of the Church.</hi> And was not this to erect <hi>Regnum in Regno?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the puniſhment and pardon of Rebels, be not a civil affair, I do not ſee what is: But rather than they will have their power docked, they will by their <hi>Inordine ad Spiritualia</hi> (their Paſtoral Sheep-hook) hook even <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Diadems</hi> within the verge of their mitered Caps and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were agitated, divers conferences paſſed between the King and them, wherein the King and his Council made many prudent and gracious Offers, and condeſcentions, with great reſpect to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Church,</hi> but no reaſonings prevailing with them, the King was forced to expreſs, and ſaid that there could be no agreement ſo long as the marches of the two Juriſdictions were not diſtinguiſhed, that in their Preachings they did cenſure the affairs of the State and Council, convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate general Aſſemblies without his Licence; conclude what they thought good, not once deſiring his Allowance and Approbation, and in their Synods, Presbyteries, and particular Seſſions, meddle with every thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on colour of ſcandal: Beſides divers other diſorders which at an other time he would propound and have reformed, elſe it was vain to think of any agreement, or that the ſame being made could ſtand, and continue any while.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe conferences laſted, theſe juſt complaints of the King were verifyed and made good by all the Presbyteries, in the perſon of Mr. <hi>David Blake,</hi> one of the Miniſters of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with whom they ſided and whom they defended to their utmoſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>David Blake</hi> in a Sermon, uttered divers ſpightful ſpeeches againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> the Lords of the Council and Seſſion, and had called the <hi>Queen of England</hi> an Atheiſt a Woman of no Religion: of which her <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> complaining to the King he was cited to appear before the Council, 10. <hi>Novemb.</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> accompanying him to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> did labour to make this a common cauſe, giving out that the ſame was done only as a preparative againſt the Miniſters to bring their Doctrine under the cenſure and controulment of the King and Council; and ſo far he prevailed with the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as they ſent certain of their number to entreat the deſerting of the Diet; <q>ſaying <hi>it would be ill taken to draw Miniſters in question upon trifling delations</hi> (very trifling matters, as you will ſee by the Articles againſt him) <hi>when as the enemies of the truth were ſpared, and overſeen.</hi>
                  </q> Proud Presbyters! <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, ſubmitted his doctrines to the Teſt and judgment of his Auditory. <hi>Judge ye what I ſay,</hi> and yet theſe inſolent Prieſts may defame <hi>Princes, Councils, Parliaments,</hi> and ſay and do what they pleaſe, <hi>impune.</hi> No man muſt ſay, why do ye ſo? a ſhrewd ſign, their Coyn is not currant when it will not abide the Touch-ſtone.</p>
               <p>They farther gave out, that the Miniſters were troubled for the free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of ſin and ſinners, and the Scepter of Chriſts Kingdom ſought to be overthrown.</p>
               <p>The proceſs they ſaid, intended againſt Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> was but a Policy to divert the Miniſters from proſecuting their Suit againſt <hi>Popiſh Earles,</hi> and if he ſhould ſubmit his doctrine to the tryal of the Council, the <hi>liberties of the Church</hi> and ſpiritual Government of the Houſe of God would be quite ſubverted, and therefore they concluded, that in any caſe a <hi>Declinator</hi> ſhould be uſed, and <hi>proteſtation</hi> made againſt theſe proceedings, whereupon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50679:22"/>a <hi>Declinator</hi> was framed and preſented by <hi>Blake, viz.</hi> 
                  <q>that ſeeing he was brought thither to be judged by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> for his doctrine, and that his anſwering to the pretended accuſation might import a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the liberties of the Church,</hi> and be taken for an acknowledgment of his <hi>Majeſties Juriſdiction</hi> in matters meerly ſpiritual. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in all Humility to <hi>decline that Judicatory,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> of whom he had the grace of his calling, had given him his Word for a Rule for his Preaching, and that he could not fall in the reverence of any Civil Law, but in ſo far as he ſhould be tryed to have paſſed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which Tryal <hi>belonged only to the Prophets</hi> and Paſtors, the <hi>ſpirit of the Prophets being ſubject to them alone:</hi> For this and other reaſons in the ſaid <hi>Declinator</hi> alledged. He for himſelf and in the name of the Commiſſioners of the general Aſſembly, who had ſubſcribed the ſame <hi>Declinator</hi> (by which it appears that <hi>Blake</hi> was not herein a ſingle but a publick perſon, and that theſe deſperate Tenets, were the Tenets of the <hi>whole Presbytery</hi> and not of <hi>Blake ſingly</hi>) did humbly beſeech his Majeſty not to infringe the <hi>liberty of the Church,</hi> but manifeſt his care in maintaining the ſame</q> 
                  <hi>i. e. in</hi> words at length and not in figures; <hi>that his Majesty would ſubject his Regality to their Presbytery,</hi> and be to them a King indeed, but yet no otherwiſe then the ſtump of Wood was to the Frogs in the Fable, a quiet and tame Idol, whom every Frog every waſpiſh Presbyter may play upon and ſecurely dance about.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee his <hi>Peccadilloes,</hi> not only charged, but ſtrongly proved againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That he affirmed in Pulpit, that the popiſh Lords were returned into the Country, with his Majeſties knowledge and on his Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſaid that in ſo doing he had detected the <hi>Treachery of his Heart. 2ly.</hi> that he had called all <hi>Kings</hi> the <hi>Devils Barnes,</hi> adding that the <hi>Devil</hi> was in the <hi>Court,</hi> and in the Guiders of it. <hi>3ly.</hi> In his Prayer for the Queen he had uſed theſe words, We muſt pray for her for the Faſhion, but we have not cauſe, for ſhe will never do us good, ſo that we have little reaſon to pray for her. <hi>4ly.</hi> That he had called the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> an Atheiſt. <hi>5ly.</hi> That he had diſcuſſ'd a ſuſpention granted by the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Seſſion</hi> in <hi>Pulpit</hi> and called them <hi>Miſcreants</hi> and <hi>Bribers. 6ly.</hi> That ſpeaking of the Nobility, he ſaid they were degenerated, Godleſs, Diſſemblers and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the <hi>Church,</hi> likewiſe ſpeaking of the <hi>Council,</hi> he called them <hi>Holy-glaſſes, Cormorants,</hi> men of no Religion. <hi>7ly.</hi> That he had convocated divers Noblemen, Barons and other within St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>June</hi> 1594. cauſed them to take Armes, and divide themſelves in Troops of Horſe, and Foot, and had thereby uſurped the Power of the <hi>King</hi> and Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The Summons being read, he deſired to be remitted to his own <hi>Ordinary,</hi> hereby meaning the <hi>Presbytery</hi> where the Doctrine was taught, contending that ſpeeches delivered in Pulpit, all be it alledged to be Treaſonable, could not be judged by the <hi>King</hi> till the <hi>Church (by which term they always mean themſelves)</hi> firſt took cogniſance thereof, and thereupon delivered the <hi>Declinator.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> notwithſtanding in favour of him deferred far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings herein, till the laſt of <hi>November.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> took advantage of his favour, and ſent a Copy of the <hi>Declinator</hi> with a Letter to all the Presbyteries requiring them to ſubſcribe the ſame and to commend the cauſe in hand in their publick and private Prayers to God, uſing their beſt credit with their flocks, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their labours for the maintenance thereof.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50679:22"/>
               <p>This their ſtirring up of Subjects againſt their King, extorted from the King by the advice of his Council a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> diſcharging the ſaid <hi>Commiſſion</hi> as unlawful in it ſelf, and more unlawfully executed by the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> commanding ſix of them to depart to their ſeveral Flocks within 24 hours, and not to return to act therein under pain of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> Upon notice of this <hi>intended Proclamation,</hi> the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that ſince they were convened <hi>by the Warrant of Christ</hi> in a moſt needful and dangerous time to ſee unto the good of the <hi>Church, &amp; ne quid eccleſia detrimenti caperet,</hi> they ſhould <hi>obey God rather than Man,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any charge that ſhould be given; would continue together ſo long as conveniently they might.</p>

               <p>Having failed herein they ſent to the <hi>King,</hi> humbly entreating a ſurceaſe of the Proceſs againſt Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> &amp;c. to which the <hi>King</hi> returned this gracious Anſwer, that if yet they would paſs by the <hi>Declinator</hi> or declare at leaſt, that it was not a general but particular Declinator, uſed in the caſe of Mr. <hi>David Blake,</hi> as being a cauſe of flander and pertaining to the judgment of the <hi>Church,</hi> he ſhould alſo paſs from the Summons and ſurceaſe the Suit. This not pleaſing, they reſolve to ſtand to the <hi>Declinator</hi> unleſs the King would paſs by the Summons, and remitting the Suit to the <hi>Eccleſiastical Judge,</hi> make an act of Council, that no Miniſter ſhould be charged for his Preaching, at leaſt before the meeting of the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Whereupon the <hi>Proclamation</hi> was publiſhed, the Commiſſioners charged to depart out of the Town, and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> by a new Summons cited to the laſt of <hi>November.</hi> 
                  <q>The <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> being advertiſed thereof, they adviſed a <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and Noblemen, praying the <hi>King</hi> that he would remit the determination of the differences to a lawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and not to <hi>incroach</hi> upon the <hi>limits of Chriſts Kingdom</hi> upon any pretence, exhorting the Noblemen that as they had been, ſo they would ſtill keep themſelves free from working any prejudice to the <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and being Executionres of the Malicious devices of thoſe who ſought the <hi>thraldome</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and that they would procure by their credit, a continuation of all Controverſies, unto a free and lawful Aſſembly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Petition prevailing nothing, <hi>Blake</hi> appeared and was convicted, it being ſound that the crimes and accuſations contained in the Summons were ſeditious and treaſonable, and that his Majeſty, his Council, and other <q>Judges ſubſtituted by his Authority, were competent Judges in all matters, either Criminal or Civil, as well to Miniſters as other Subjects.</q> Though <hi>Robert Pont</hi> after the Summons were read, proteſted that the Proceſs in hand, and whatſoever followed thereupon ſhould not prejudice the <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in matters of Doctrine, whereunto the King anſwered he would only cenſure Treaſonable Speeches of a Miniſter in a Sermon which he and his Council would judge. Notwithſtanding all this, ſo gracious was the King, that he ſought by all gentle means and ſound reaſons proſering Pardon Amneſty and Reſtauration to <hi>Blake,</hi> &amp;c. But the more gracious his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions were (which were not a few) the more refractory ſtubborn and inſolent were the Presbyters, inſomuch that when the <hi>King</hi> ſent to them, that he did not intend to uſe <hi>Blake</hi> with rigor, Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50679:23"/>Name of the reſt anſwered, <q>that if the matter had concerned <hi>Blake</hi> alone the offer might be accepted: But the <hi>liberty of Christs Kingdome</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a <hi>wound</hi> by the ſaid proceedings, <hi>uſurping ſpiritual Judicatory,</hi> as if <hi>Blakes</hi> life and the lives of twenty others had been taken, it would not have grieved the hearts of good Brethren ſo much as theſe injurious proceedings had done, and that either theſe things behoved to be retreated or they would oppoſe ſo long as they had breath.</q> Brave Blades ſtill! and they were as good as their words, ſtanding it out to the uttermoſt, by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſedition, and raiſing tumults, till at laſt ſome of the chiefeſt of them were forced to fly to <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon all theſe Conferences with the <hi>King,</hi> and anſwers returned of his Meſſages, the Burden of their Song was ſtill, <q>That their Meſſages and Commiſſion <hi>ought not to be controuled in a Civil Judicature,</hi> nay tho they preached ſeditiouſly or rebelliouſly, for which tho they ought to be puniſhed, yet it ought to be firſt cognoſſed by the <hi>Church;</hi>
                  </q> unto which the <hi>King</hi> once replied, <hi>and ſhall not I have power to call and puniſh a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ſo preaching, but must come to your Presbytery and be a Complainer? I have good proof in the Proceſs of</hi> Gibſon <hi>and</hi> Roſs <hi>what justice you would do me.</hi> When nothing would ſatisfie them, on the ſecond of <hi>December</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was given that <hi>Blake</hi> had faſly ſlandred and treaſonably calumniated the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Queen, Queen Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Lords of his Council</hi> and <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> therefore his puniſhment being remitted to the King, it was ordained, that till his Majeſties pleaſure ſhould be declared, he ſhould be confined beyond the <hi>North Water,</hi> and enter into his ward within ſix days.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral Treaties after this Sentence in order to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but ſtill the ſame ſpirit reigned in them, and they returned as proud and inſolent anſwers, in ſo much that the Lord <hi>Lyndſey</hi> told the <hi>King</hi> on their behalf, that they durſt convene againſt his Proclamation, and do more than ſo, and that they would not ſuffer Religion to be overthrown: at which the <hi>King</hi> leaving the room, <hi>Lyndſey</hi> returned to the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſaid, there was no courſe but one, <hi>Let us ſtay together that are here, and promiſe to take one part,</hi> and <hi>advertiſe our Friends,</hi> and the Favourers of Religion to come unto us, for it ſhall be either <hi>Theirs or Ours.</hi> Hence a great clamour <hi>to Arms</hi> to bring out <hi>Haman,</hi> others cryed The <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Gideon;</hi> ſo great was the fury of the People.</p>
               <p>This produced new Petitions and new Conferences, yet all but ſecond parts to the ſame tune, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> they will cry ſome hours, ſome weeks together, rather than they will loſe their <hi>ſpiritual Independent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> and <hi>Judicatory</hi> over <hi>King, Council,</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and during this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conteſt, Mr. <hi>John Welch</hi> preaching in the <hi>High Church,</hi> ſaid, <hi>the King was poſſeſſed of a Devil, and one Devil being caſt out, ſeven more was entred in place, And that the Subjects might lawfully riſe and take the Sword out of his hand, which he confirmed by the example of a Father, that falling in a frenzy, might be taken by the Children and Servants of the Family, and tied hand and foot from doing violence.</hi> Brave Goſpel Doctrine! fit for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> and his <hi>Pulpits,</hi> who may perhaps grant Priviledges and Prerogatives to his <hi>Church,</hi> exempting his <hi>Clergy</hi> and Miniſters from all queſtioning: But my Creed is, that happily ſuch Priviledges and Liberties may be in their Books or in their Alcoran, but not <hi>in Bibliis ſacris.</hi> Thus the Chorus and Burden of the Song is, that every Contradiction of a waſpiſh Prieſt is an incroachment upon the <hi>limits of Christs Kingdom:</hi> a prejudice to the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>

I muſt confeſs I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found them writing <hi>in terminis</hi> for this <hi>Infallibility:</hi> But if we may gueſs at their meaning by their mumping, their Actions and their Arguments are premiſſes which to ſome may ſeem to yield ſuch concluſions, that they would fain have their Doctrines, though treaſonable, to be embraced as Oracles: Are not theſe Doctrines purely Romiſh? ſurely yes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was certainly more infallible than they, and yet he ſubmitted his Preachments to his Auditory in general, not excluſive the <hi>Laity, Judg ye what I ſay.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Layity</hi> as well as Prieſts are commanded to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures and try Spirits,</hi> and ſhall not the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Sages,</hi> Judg of Doctrines, becauſe delivered in a Pulpit, which may concern the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> nay perhaps, the very <hi>eſſe,</hi> quiet ſtate, and weal of a Kingdom. If I were put to it, I ſhould not doubt but to make it out, that there is as good warrant in Scripture for the <hi>infallibility</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> as there is for either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> though I muſt profeſs, there is no ſound ground, no nor yet probable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for either.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Presbiter</hi> will have his Doctrines received without controulment and contradiction, he muſt ſhew better warrant than the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe he pretends to judg (what I think the <hi>Pope</hi> doth not) even <hi>Affections. Spotſw. Hiſt.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> in his form of <hi>Church Policy</hi> preſented by him to the Parliament ſitting in <hi>Striveling, Anno</hi> 1578. hath this head, <hi>The Magistrate commands in external things only, and actions done before Men: But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ruler</hi> (ſuch as Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi> and his fellow Presbyters are) <hi>judgeth both the Aſſections and the external Actions in reſpect of conſcience by the word of God.</hi> In which form there are other dangerous heads ſutable to what <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> and the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> ſo ſharply contended for in his cauſe, and what tumults, &amp;c. enſued thereupon in the Conteſt for that deſperate form Hiſtories do abundantly ſhew; but I forbear. But ſeeing they make ſo deſperate ill uſe of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. by perverting very plain texts, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved (though no Presbyter) to try if I can hit the true and natural ſenſe and meaning thereof, ſeeing they have not, and perhaps will not, it not being for their intereſt and prerogatives.</p>
               <p>§. Its true <hi>the Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. but what doth this avail Pope or Presbyters, ſurely they will not ſay, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> ſince the Apoſtles days are ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and infallible as thoſe of the <hi>Old.</hi> Beſides, what if the terms <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and <hi>Propheſying</hi> are in ſome ſenſes and places, and happily in this, as applicable to the <hi>Laity</hi> as to the <hi>Clergy?</hi> nay, what if in this very Text by <hi>Prophets</hi> is meant in general, <hi>all Believers,</hi> thoſe within the Pale of the <hi>Church,</hi> excluding thoſe only without as unfit to judg ſuch matters? Mark the Conteſt; Firſt <hi>Propheſying (in general) ſerveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe,</hi> v. 22. Secondly, <hi>If therefore the whole</hi> Church (not Prieſts only) <hi>come together in one place, and all ſpeak, &amp;c.</hi> v. 23. <hi>and</hi> All <hi>propheſy,</hi> v. 24. <q>
                     <hi>And</hi> every one <hi>of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. 26. If <hi>any man</hi> ſpeak, v. 27. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50679:24"/>let the other judg,</hi> v. 29. <hi>If any thing be revealed to</hi> Another <hi>that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace,</hi> v. 30. <hi>For ye may all propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> v. 31. <hi>And the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> v. 32. <hi>Let the Women keep ſilence,</hi> &amp;c. v. 31. <hi>wherefore Brethren covet to propheſy,</hi> v. 39.</q> Now if the words or terms of <hi>Whole Church, All, Every one, Any man, The other, Another, Brethren</hi> be words and terms of univerſality, and differencing, then certainly the words <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Propheſying</hi> are in this Chapter more eſpecially applicable to the Auditory, the Brethren than to the Presbyters themſelves, and is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and warrant to the faithful to aſſemble and ſpeak to edification; beſides the commanding of the <hi>Women</hi> ſilence, is a pregnant preſumption, if not an affirmation, That all the <hi>Brethren</hi> might ſpeak: ſo likewiſe is the command to the <hi>Brethren to covet to propheſy.</hi> But be it as they would have it, that by <hi>Prophets</hi> are meant <hi>Presbyters only,</hi> which is impoſſible in true conſtruction, but the contrary, yet thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> by the command of the ſame Apoſtle, v. 29. <hi>are to be judged by the other,</hi> that are not <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which is a better warrant to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> to judg them, than they can ſhew to <hi>Judg, King and Council,</hi> and to uſurp Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves only: Beſides the very command in the very firſt verſe is <hi>to all to follow Charity, to deſire Spiritual gifts, but rather that they may propheſy;</hi> and by <hi>propheſying</hi> by the ſcope of this Chapter is clearly meant <hi>ſpeaking to edification and exhortation and comfort, that our words might miniſter Grace to the Hearers;</hi> which certainly is the duty of every man; and which, if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> had obſerved, he had never been called in queſtion. Now tell me how much leſs doth the <hi>Presbyter</hi> claim than the <hi>Pope,</hi> who pretends, that every <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Church-man,</hi> both they and their Family; nay the <hi>very Concubines of Priests are exempt</hi> from all Juriſdiction Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that <hi>jure divino;</hi> and that from the ſame <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>He that is ſpiritual judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man.</hi> The ſame Scripture is as ſtrong for the <hi>Presbyter</hi> as the <hi>Pope;</hi> and it is to be feared that if he were as faſt in the Saddle as the <hi>Pope</hi> is, that he would claim it as peremptorily, and therefore ſit to be prevented by the wiſdom of Princes. But were the Allegations true and pertinent, either there ſhould be no Spiritual man beſides the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and ſo the ſubject of the Propoſition ſhould be <hi>homo ſingularis,</hi> one man only; or if there be more Spiritual men, they ſhould all of them be <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> to judg all others, and be judged of none, no not of the <hi>Pope of Rome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> unleſs he be <hi>no body.</hi> For thoſe are convertible, he that ſaith all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth none, and he that ſaith none excepteth all. Touching the <hi>Propheſy</hi> we hold ſaith <hi>J. Robinſon, f.</hi> 45, 46. the very ſame that the <hi>Synod</hi> (held at <hi>Embden,</hi> 1571.) hath declared, <hi>Harm. Synod.

               <p>§. During the Conteſt between <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth and the <hi>German Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1523. in the caſe of <hi>Luther,</hi> they thinking it reaſonable did ſignify unto his <hi>Holineſs</hi> from the Dyet at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> that <hi>married Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Religious perſons,</hi> who returned to the world in caſe they did commit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50679:24"/>any wickedneſs that the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Magistrate</hi> in whoſe Territory they ſhall offend, ought to give them their due chaſtiſement, which did not pleaſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> and therefore he did reply, That it would be againſt the <hi>Liberty of the Church,</hi> and the Sickle would be put into another mans Field, and thoſe men would be cenſured by the World who were reſerved unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For Princes ſhould not preſume to believe that they were devolved to their Juriſdiction by their <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> nor that they could be puniſhed by them, and for their other Offences, in regard the <hi>Character remaining in them,</hi> and the <hi>Order,</hi> they are ever under the power of the <hi>Church;</hi> neither can Princes do more than delate them to their <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Superiors,</hi> that they may chaſtize them, <hi>Conc.

Thus let <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> go hand in hand as to <hi>Spiritual Empire</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> Though it be beſides my purpoſe to examine particulars, yet in the general I cannot but wonder that ſo many learned and conſcientious perſons, men of great abilities and good lives, ſhould countenance and defend <hi>that Church Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as it is compoſed and compounded by <hi>Calvin,</hi> the firſt <hi>Brocher</hi> and Hammerer thereof as taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the Word of God, when no Father ever witneſſed, no Council ever favoured, no <hi>Church</hi> ever found out or practiſed it ſince the days of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and when the general and ſucceſſive conſent of all ſucceeding Ages is reſolute againſt it, as never expounding <hi>Pauls</hi> words in favour of it till about this laſt Century; and this in oppoſition unto, and derogation of <hi>Epiſcopal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,</hi> which on the contrary hath been obſerved every where for many Ages and Generations throughout the Chriſtian world, <hi>nemine contradicente</hi> except the old Heretick <hi>Aerius:</hi> No <hi>Church</hi> till <hi>Calvins</hi> time ever alledging or perceiving the Word of God to be againſt it: for if but any one <hi>Church</hi> upon the face of the whole earth, that hath been governed by <hi>Calvins</hi> or the <hi>Scotch Presbytery,</hi> or any one <hi>Church</hi> that hath not been ordered by Epiſcopal Regiment ſince the death of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could poſſibly have been found out, no doubt but that we ſhould long ſince have heard of it with our ears, and ſeen it with our eyes in their Writings, for that the Favourers and Abettors thereof have wanted neither abilities, induſtry, nor ſtomack neither to make it known.</p>
               <p>Beſides to me it ſeems ſtrangely improbable (I might ſay impoſſible) that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould never know what belonged to the Government of her ſelf till of late, and that the Son of God ſhould be ſpoiled of half his Kingdom by his own Servants, Citizens, nay Martyrs for 1500 <hi>years together,</hi> without remorſe or remembrance of any one man, that ſo great injury was offered him, and without one <hi>Champion</hi> to throw out his Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in the demand and challenge of his right. Moreover how is it poſſible that all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the world ſhould with one conſent immediately on the Apoſtles deaths reject that form of governing the <hi>Church</hi> according to the <hi>Geneva cut</hi> (which they would fain perſwade you to believe was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and approved by the Apoſtles) and embrace a new and ſtrange kind of Government <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> without Precept or Precedent for their ſo doing; for my part I think it much more ſafe, prudent, and reaſonable to eſteem this a <hi>new device</hi> of <hi>Calvins</hi> (a <hi>Chintera</hi> of his own brain, ſet up to ſerve his own ends, and to introduce his own Domination) than to proclaim ſo many Apoſtolick men and antient learned Fathers, to be manifeſt deſpiſers of <hi>Epiſcopal Diſcipline,</hi> and voluntary Supporters, if not Inventers, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists</hi> Pride and Tyranny.</p>

               <p>§. I find four Priviledges extraordinary given by Chriſt to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Function requiſite for the firſt founding of the <hi>Church.</hi>

Diſpenſing the Word; 2. Adminiſtring the Sacraments; 3. Impoſing of hands; 4. <hi>Guiding</hi> the <hi>Keys</hi> to ſhut or open the Kingdom of Heaven. Theſe, eſpecially the three firſt parts of the Apoſtolic Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not decayed, and cannot be wanted in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and are now ſeated in our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> by <hi>Apoſtolic ſucceſſive delegation.</hi> The firſt Two, by reaſon they are the ordinary means and inſtruments by which the Spirit of God worketh each mans ſalvation, muſt be general to all Paſtors and Presbyters; the other Two, according to common accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, rather reſpect the governing and cleanſing of <hi>Chriſts Church;</hi> and therefore in the opinion of ſome, no reaſon they ſhould be committed to the power of every Presbyter, as the Word and Sacraments are, as <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> would have it: For as there can be no order, but confuſion in a Common-wealth where every man ruleth, ſo would there be no peace but confuſion in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> if every Presbyter might impoſe hands, and uſe the Keys at his pleaſure.

               <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>great Apostle</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. did long to ſee the <hi>Romans that he might be comforted together with them through their mutual Faith both theirs and his,</hi> it is evident that one mans faith may by ſuch aſſembling be helpful to another, though not to juſtify, yet to comfort and confirm, when as they ſhall ſee their own experimental perſwaſions backed with the experiences and teſtimonies of others. And though the experience of Gods Children together in the Word do ſufficiently eſtabliſh us in truths, yet it is a confirmation not to be neglected that we have others of our Brethren from like experience with us to give teſtimony thereto. And it were to be wiſhed that ſuch <hi>Christian Aſſemblies</hi> and Conferences were for this end more carefully uſed not forbidden. No doubt the concent of Gods Children in the ſame truths would add unto us no ſmall comfort, and Confirmation. <hi>Ferus in Math.</hi> 11. reports of a kind of conference in uſe among the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Heremites and Monks,</hi> that they were wont to meet together, and there freely to lay open each to other their ſeveral temptations, means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and gracious iſſue for counſel, comfort, confirmation. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An excellent example of the like we have in the worthy Preacher Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers</hi> of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in his 7 Treatiſes. <hi>Treat.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13.14.</p>

To <hi>do good to all men,</hi> and to help to ſave Souls, is to Chriſtians a <hi>Law moral,</hi> never to be forgotten, never to be omitted, God being always pleaſed with ſuch Sacrifice. Beſides, it is not without great Example. How many of the <hi>Laity</hi> in all Ages and Countries have by writing for the publick good propagated the Goſpel of Chriſt, as if ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Inſtinct of Nature, or ſome Illapſe from Heaven had ſpirited them ſo to do? To obviate here ſome uſual Objections or calumnies. It is frivolous to think that by the <hi>Laity</hi> thus ingaging, that the Honour of the <hi>Clergy</hi> is thereby Ecclipſed, or their profit diminiſhed, or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in Government will enſue. No, no. But on the contrary, their countenancing of ſuch perſons is their Honour, demonſtrating to all the World how unblameably they walk, ſhewing joy of any helpers in the Lords Vineyard, in gaining Souls to Heaven; deeming it a pitiful muck-worm-ſpirit, ſavouring too rankly of Earthly, and too little of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs, to ground their Honour and Veneration upon other Mens ignorance <hi>(as the Papists do)</hi> as if their more full and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſhould diſcover and judge of their defects and aberrations. Our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Clergy</hi> bids defiance to all ſuch little durty Intrigues. Let <hi>Rome</hi> appropriate that Glory, that priviledge to her ſelf, and boaſt of their own Principle and Maxim, that <hi>ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Clergy ſcorn to be pettiſh and froward, that the <hi>Laity</hi> contribute their Talents in participating of their charge, <hi>their labour in the Lord.</hi> They know it is more agreeable to their calling to wiſh with <hi>Moſes.</hi> 11 <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. <hi>that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them,</hi> and that every man did think himſelf bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to diſcharge a part of the common good of all Chriſtians, and did believe that the care of other mens Souls, did concern them as well as the care of their own, and that they ought to <hi>love their Neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>

               <p>When the Apoſtle took order to <hi>Ordain ſome,</hi> on whom the burthen of <hi>Preaching the Goſpel</hi> ſhould be more particularly incumbent as a more peculiar duty upon them, they did not thereby <hi>impropriate and confine</hi> Preaching, or Inſtructing ſo wholly to thoſe Perſons only, as to ſtifle and ſuppreſs all other mens Talents that were not Ordained, that had been to <hi>limit the Holy one of Iſrael,</hi> and to contradict their other more general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>viz. of ſpeaking</hi> (and conſequently of writing) <hi>to Edifycation, that they might administer Grace unto the hearers</hi> and readers: But they pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſidering <hi>that every mans care was no mans care,</hi> they in their moſt wiſe and Chriſtian care did more eſpecially Ordain ſome, whoſe <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſhould be to ſerve at the Altar,</hi> and attend on the Goſpel alone, whoſe voyces we were to hear as ſent by God himſelf, the better to keep the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Miniſtry in great veneration to the end of the World, and that they ſhould teach as <hi>e Cathedra,</hi> as perſons ſet apart and ordained to the

Let private profeſſion and practice of Chriſtianity improve never ſo much, yet the great honour of worthy publick Profeſſors can never be impaired but advanced thereby while the Goſpel laſteth; but this their right and great honour impeacheth not the general right which all Chriſtians have to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy each others good, to endeavour the <hi>converſion</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> of one another. <hi>Tu autem converſus confirma fratres.</hi> It is a general Command to all, and conſequently a duty perpetually obliging <hi>to deſire</hi> earneſtly <hi>ſpiritual gifts, but rather that they may propheſie,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. in which Chapter by <hi>Prophets</hi> is not meant the <hi>Clergy</hi> only (as it is generally ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood) but <hi>all Christians</hi> in general; and by <hi>Propheſying</hi> is meant <hi>ſpeaking unto men to edification, and exhortation and comfort, V.</hi> 3. the duty of every individual. And I do not know but that a ſolemn private Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Chriſtians met in theſe our days in the name and fear of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing holy duties and Ordinances, is as true a Church in Goſpel under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the like number ſo congregated in the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Theſe things rightly conſidered, I cannot but wonder (and that not without ſome aſtoniſhment) with what face or ſhew of conſcience any, eſpecially of our <hi>Proteſtant Clergy</hi> (for in our Alternate changes they have been all ſome way or other this way culpable) whether Prelate Presbyter, or Independent, (all ſtriving to ſet up themſelves) can countenance, adviſe or any way conſent to forbid ſuch Aſſembling; is it not enough that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the preſent <hi>Establiſhed Government</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> be the <hi>qualification</hi> to all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Livings</hi> and <hi>Preferments</hi> for thoſe that can and will ſubmit and conform thereto, but they muſt ſilence diſſenters as truly worſhipping and ſerving God in truth as themſelves, tho happily not ſo modiſhly, nor yet ſo Ceremoniouſly: I pray God forgive them, and that the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Whited wall</hi> given to the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> by <hi>St. Paul</hi> may never be their doom.</p>
               <p>§. In things indifferent and good, ſo they be liberal and free, it may ſo happen that an error may be committed againſt the Princes command, but for thoſe duties that are expreſly commanded by God, the 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 29. <hi>Its better to obey God than Man,</hi> muſt take place. Conſider the contrary, if a Prince command lawful things, muſt we notwithſtanding have licenſe from another to obey him? and without it, is it a <hi>Non licet?</hi> And ſhall not Gods Commands be lawfully obeyed without licenſe from another? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all her ſinal drifts giveth alſo ſuch faculties and powers as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary for attaining the ſame: and ſhall God preſcribe an end and Commandments, and ſhall they not be obeyed and put in practice without the favour and licenſe of men? <hi>Abſit!</hi> its too abſurd and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. I have been the freer herein, becauſe I have been ſo far from frequenting or countenancing ſuch Aſſemblies by my preſence, that I have been but once at any one of them above theſe 20 years, nor do I converſe with any of them. Happily I can conform with better ſatisfaction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience than they can that ſo congregate.</p>

Indeed they have no known Rules, no eſtabliſhed Principles, no Doctrine infallible to be Governed by, the light within them, being only the Rule and Guide of their Conſciences, which may be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> to day, and <hi>Crucifige</hi> tomorrow, no Connivence, no Tolleration due to thoſe Religions whoſe Principles are unknown, or deſtroy our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

For Example, If a <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath ſwallowed a ſolemn League and Covenant ſo ſolemnly, that he cannot, nor will not renounce it, what ſhould the Government do? Indulge thoſe that will not protect that; It portends a <hi>dangerous Reſerve,</hi> a ſower Leaven, Tinder in the Boſom, apt to take ſire, apt to relapſe into the ſame prodigious miſchiefs. Is it not much more agreeable to ſound reaſon, that the Royal Son ſhould pare the Nails of thoſe that cannot diſgorge themſelves of that fatal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which introduced thoſe Premiſes which yielded that ſanguinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which made the Father a Glorious King, by bringing of him to the Block? Conſcience of factious Prieſts or of Covenanters in ſuch caſes, is not aduſt in any meaſure, Adaequate in the Ballance againſt the ſafety, peace, and quiet of Crowns, and Kingdoms for that we have no <hi>Lydius lapis,</hi> no infallible touch-ſtone to diſcover whether Conſciences are truly weak, or only pretended to be ſo, the ſearcher of hearts only knows that inſallibly. And if pretence may be a juſt excuſe to warrant diſobedience unto eſtabliſhed Sanctions, Laws would then be no Laws at all, for he that would might, and he that would not, might chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would obey or no, for that no Man can diſtinguiſh between real, and pretended Scrupuloſities. That ſome ſhould be indulged, and others not, ought to be no cauſe of complaint neither, for that every thing is n t convenient for every Body, nor for every Sect and State, the ſame
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50679:33"/>Legiſlators that have power to Indulge ſome, may by the ſame right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid others, and indeed make any Laws convenient. For the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ought to be always kept in a quiet and peaceable temper, even <hi>ad pondus</hi> if poſſible: enough! This only by way of Hint and Caution, that there be great waryneſs, and circumſpection in granting, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indulgences. If Prieſts otherwiſe Orthodox, and worthy, be ſilenced for ſuch or the like reaſons, this ariſeth not from the diſcipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor from the Nature of <hi>Lyturgies,</hi> but from the Government of the State. What? Muſt there then be no relief for ſcrupulous and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences that cannot renounce Covenants, or comply with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies, and Commands? yes, if they are truly ſo, and do not enter-ſere with the Eſtabliſhed Government of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences really and truly Scrupulous, and tender, if they break not out into overt act are not within the Magiſtrates Province, but if raſhly without conſideration of obtaining, or foreſight of peril or perturbation of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> they will adventure to take <hi>Solemn Leagues and Covenants</hi> to introduce a ſeparate Mode or Government in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> contrary to that already eſtabliſhed by the Magiſtrate, then they moſt properly come within his verge and cognizance. 2. Conſciences ought ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally not to be forced, nay, cannot whilſt they are in their proper cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but are to be gained, and reduced by dint of Argument and force of Truth, by moderate connivence, and by the uſe of good Inſtruction, and perſwaſion. 3. Conſciences when they rove and become <hi>excentrick,</hi> moving beyond their proper circle and bounds, and being out of their proper Sphear, tend and prove to be matter of Faction, looſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nature, and forfeit their juſt Priviledges and Prerogatives, then, and not till then, the civil Magiſtrate may take notice, and juſtly reſtrain or puniſh their undue practiſes, and contempts, if ſuch, though guilded moſt ſpeciouſly with pretences of Conſcience and Religion.</p>
               <p>§. As happily their opinion is not ſo infallibly orthodox, who affirm that all <hi>Church Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> muſt be after one Platform, and that they which will perfectly reform, muſt bring and reduce the form unto the State which it was at in the days of the Apoſtles. A thing in the opinion of Judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> neither poſſible nor certain, nor yet abſolutely convenient. For that which was uſed in their dayes, the Scripture (he ſaith) doth not fully declare, ſo that making thoſe times the Rule and <hi>Canon of Church Government,</hi> they make a Rule which not being poſſible to be fully known, is as impoſſible to be fully kept: ſo happily their opinion is as little Orthodox, and as little convenient, who deem it no good policy, to alter or innovate any thing in <hi>Church affairs,</hi> or to endeavour to reduce it to that State wherein it ſtood in the dayes of the Apoſtles, the one opinion conducing to bring Reformation to Anullity, the other to an Impoſſibility. In elder times, ſoon after the dayes of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and more eſpecially after <hi>Constantines</hi> dayes there were imperfections no doubt, and warpings from the <hi>Apostolical Rules</hi> and <hi>practiſes,</hi> and happily in ſome things greater than in the preſent. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity therefore ought not ſo to be revered, and adored, as that ſomething in theſe latter Ages may not be reputed better, and more convenient, there being no neceſſity, that the ſame publick things ſhould be always ordered in one and the ſelf ſame manner, but as times have mutations, ſo it may be ſit to alter or change the Government of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> It is poſſible that the Antient manner of Governing may not be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50679:33"/>except the Antient ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> do return alſo: But if Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity muſt be ſo revered as not to admit of the leaſt Innovation, then without all peradventure that Government which Chriſt and his Apoſtles inſtituted and leſt unto his <hi>Church</hi> muſt neceſſarily be the moſt Antient, and have the faireſt pretence unto <hi>Jus divinum</hi> for its juſtification; and then for thoſe very reaſons ought to remain unto this very day unalterable, and all other Modes and Forms can be but Prudential only, and at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church</hi> rightly ſo called. And there can be no doubt but that Chriſt left ſuch a Government to his <hi>Church</hi> as might be exerciſed in any Kingdom, Chriſtian or other, without enterfering or claſhing with the Civil Government of any Nation or Kingdom whereſoever the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their Succeſſors in all Ages and Countries ſhould preach the Goſpel, and gather Churches. And that the ſelf-ſame Government is plainly ſet down in the new Teſtament, and that it was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and that the Antient Fathers after their example did proſecute the ſame for about 250 years after Chriſt with great ſucceſs and increaſe of Converts unto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. And ſuch Government being practicable then, notwithſtanding the great enmity that all Nations and Governments had even unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf there can be no doubt, and no reaſon can evince but it may be as practicable now, which is the opinion of very many, and thoſe not <hi>Phanaticks.</hi> And then <hi>Independents</hi> will have very fair and antient Records to ſhew for their Congregational way, if not the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p>§. With all wiſe and ſober-minded perſons, Cuſtome and Uſage obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that reverence and eſteem as to yield a juſt ground for deliberation before it be altered, or abrogated, though not of abſolute direction and adherency. All Conſtitutions and ordinances concern the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> be they never ſo pure in their firſt inſtitution may corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and why the Civil State ſhould be purged and reformed by new Laws, deviſing remedies as faſt as times breed and diſcover inconveniences, and miſchiefs: And the Eccleſiaſtical State of this or that Kingdom ſhould ſtill continue on its lees or dreggs, without refining or purifying by new Canons and Conſtitutions, is beyond the comprehenſion of all ſober minds and reaſon. <hi>H. Grotius</hi> makes this obſervation on the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.14. <hi>He removed the High places, and brake the Images, cut down the Groves, and brake in pieces the Brazen Serpent that Moſes had made.</hi> Nota <hi>quem ſecerat Moſes, Egregium Regibus documentum, ut quamvis bene inſtituta ſed non neceſſaria ubi</hi>

Grotius</hi> notes as an excellent document for Kings, that things never ſo well, never ſo lawfully inſtituted, as the Brazen Serpent (was by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf) if not neceſſary, and grow to be abuſed, ought to be taken away (as King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Serpent) leaſt they prove a Snare and an offence unto the weaker Brethren. Moreover, if an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be laid upon all men to ſubſcribe and conform to the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion and Worship, by the very ſelf ſame reaſon the next year he may be obliged to ſubſcribe and conform to the contrary, and ſo unto all Religions in the world ſucceſſively.</p>
               <p>§. As a perverſe and a moroſe retaining of Cuſtomes and Uſages may be as prejudicial to right Reformation as Innovations; ſo to remove Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nay Cuſtoms or Rights that may be ſpared without prejudice unto true Worſhip, and the Doctrine of Faith, doth not impeach good Orders, nor lawful Authority, but ratify and eſtablish them. Gods Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Vineyard, and a good Husband, who is ever pruning therein,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50679:34"/>not unſeaſonably, not unskilfully, but lightly and prudently he findeth ever ſomewhat to do.</p>
               <p>If men were peaceably minded, methinks it were not hard to agree in this, That every Church, be it of <hi>England, France, Sweden,</hi> &amp;c. do that which is convenient for the State of it ſelf, and of the Common-wealth: The antient and true bounds of Unity, being <hi>one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> and not <hi>one Ceremony, one Policy;</hi> ſuppoſe another were a better form, yet not always that which is beſt, but of good things that which is beſt and may be had with leaſt prejudice, is to be embraced. Our <hi>Church</hi> is not now to plant; it is ſettled and eſtabliſhed. In Civil States ſuppoſe a Republick in the opinion of ſome, to be a better policy than a Kingdom, yet God forbid that lawful Kingdoms ſhould be obliged to innovate and make alterations, as often as men given to change deſire or plead for it; Gods Providence is to be conſulted as well as his Word. There are Schiſmatical Cuſtoms, as well as Schiſmatical Doctrines and Opinions: So as the Civil Magiſtrate take care that the general Rules be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſts Flock be duly fed; that there be authentick Ordination, a Succeſſion in Biſhops and Miniſters, that there be a due and reverend uſe of the Keys, a due Adminiſtration of the Sacraments; that thoſe that preach the Goſpel do live by the Goſpel; that all things tend to Edification, and that all things be done in order and with decency: the reſt may be left to the diſcretion and prudence of inferiour Labourers, and we ought to acquieſce. The Preſident of that City is very ſevere, which permitteth none to propound new Laws that had not a cord about their Necks, ready for vengeance if it were found unprofitable: but by their leaves, all Innovations are not to be rejected; for divine <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth us, in all Common-wealths on juſt grounds there ought to be ſome changes, and that States-men therein ought to imitate skilful Muſicians, <hi>Qui artem Muſices non mutant, ſed Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſices modum.</hi> And it is not unworthy our obſervation, that even evil forms of Policy have been ſometimes well ordered and rectified by good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Commanders; and ſo the State of <hi>Boetia</hi> flouriſhed once under <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and yet it owed this Proſperity not to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, for that was ill conſtituted, but to the Governours, for they were wiſe and virtuous. The contrary alſo happened to <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> for that fared ill ſometimes, and ſuffered much diſtempers, becauſe though its fundamental Laws were good, yet its <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ephori</hi> were many times tyrannous and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>§. More particularly the Congregational Government, though <hi>ab initio</hi> it were in uſe, and may be again if the <hi>National Church</hi> thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: And I do not know but that it will ſuit now with any Government as well as when Chriſt did inſtitute it; but the truth is, it hath been quite of date and doors, as they would now ſet it up, ever ſince whole Cities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and Kingdoms became Chriſtian, and have been mutually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated and interwoven one with the other; however the Doctrine and Tenet thereof is as ſound and as practicable now as ever.</p>
               <p>The Arguments which the Independents bring to prove the conſiſtency of their Congregational way with our Kingly and Civil Government, are only prudential and probable, which I ſhall not go about to contradict or examin, but <hi>exmantiſſa</hi> grant, not only their Conſiſtency with our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that alſo the Civil Magiſtrates may ſo govern if they pleaſe, they ſubmitting to <hi>Indubitable Ordination</hi> (as I take Epiſcopal to be) for it is not ſit that any Ordinance ſo very eſſential to the very making and perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Goſpel Miniſtry, should be left upon a <hi>Moot point,</hi> as it would
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50679:34"/>be, if either Presbyterian or Independent Ordination ſhould take place: But then I hope the Congregational men will be as ingenuous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline and Government already eſtabliſhed, is as conſiſtent with our Civil Laws and Government, and that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power may continue the ſame Government, or alter it to any other form, ſo it be of force to ſuppreſs Vice, and to maintain true Faith and Religion, even to that <hi>Gallintaufrey Platform,</hi> eſtabliſhing Presbytery (which is but a minced or cantonized Papacy in point of Rule and Domination) by order and ordinance of that <hi>demy-parliament</hi> 29. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1648. which hath no good foundation in Scripture, no ground in Reaſon, no Authority beyond <hi>Jo. Calvin</hi> to make it good. But Chriſtian Common-wealths, and Civil Magiſtrates may eſtabliſh what Government ſo qualified they pleaſe, the thing I contend for. Its true that the Prieſts of divers perſwaſions will highly careſs Majeſty in words: But if the Civil Magiſtrate offer to impoſe but a <hi>Cap,</hi> a <hi>Surplice,</hi> a croſs <hi>in Baptiſm,</hi> or the like, then they ſtiffly cry out, where is your Rule, your Warrant in Scripture for them? And may not the Magiſtrate with as good Logick demand of Presbyter and Independent their expreſs Warrant and Rule of Scripture for their Governments, for receiving the Communion ſitting, or for their altering the time of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or their Preaching in their Caps, in a Cloak, or Buff Coats as lately they did.</p>
               <p>If men were humble and not wedded to their own fancies, they might ſee the right <hi>Independency</hi> already eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom, and with no great difference from that of the Independents, who would have only <hi>Churches</hi> voluntarily gathered and ſubmitted unto, whereby thoſe that would might be of <hi>Peters,</hi> or of <hi>Pauls,</hi> or of any Miniſters Congregation, and thoſe that would not, might refuſe to be of either, or indeed of any, ſo that in effect (they having no power to compel) the whole Kingdom might be either <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts, Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> nay, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Ranters,</hi> or indeed what not, if no better care were taken? But the great wiſdom of our Princes (armed with the Sword, and with Power to Command and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from on High) well knowing it a duty incumbent upon them (as it was once upon <hi>Paul</hi>) to take care of all the perſons and <hi>Churches</hi> within their Dominions, and that they were to be accomptable to God for their good or evil Government in <hi>Church</hi> and State) have divided this whole Nation into Precincts, Pariſhes, or Congregations (call them what you will) and hath allotted to every Pariſh a <hi>Church,</hi> to which all are enjoyned to reſort and frequent, and a Miniſter endowed with maintenance, who is to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Paſtoral Office over them, and his Pariſhoners are compellable by by the Laws, Canons, and Edicts of the Prince, to receive their ſpiritual Food and Bread of Life at his hand, and mouth, and it is not left to them to come, or not to come to the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and hear the Law, and the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt at their pleaſure: But care hath been and is ſtill taken, that the Miniſters and Paſtors ſhall not be without their Flocks, nor the Flocks without their Paſtors; who are licenced and enjoyned, to Pray, Preach, Baptize, Now what is the difference? The Congregational way is voluntary, unlimited and unpreſcribed: the Parochial is <hi>quodam modo</hi> compulſory, bounded and circumſcribed, and ſo it ought to be, or elſe how can Princes rationally give any good Accompt to God of their care of his <hi>Churches,</hi> if they ſhould leave every man to do herein what ſeemeth beſt in his own eyes? as once in <hi>Iſrael when there was no King.</hi> And if Princes have no Power to Preſcribe, Compel and Puniſh, why ſhould they be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50679:35"/>blamed and puniſhed, for the Idolatrous and otherwiſe erronious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of others? And if they have power, why do the Non-conformiſts quarrel at the uſe thereof? one Pariſh is as little dependant on another as the Congregational men would have their Congregations to be, and yet both Pariſhes and Congregations are properly, and rather <hi>homogenial parts</hi> of <hi>Englands Church,</hi> than ſo many <hi>diſtinct Churches,</hi> though <hi>Quodam Modo</hi> they may be ſtiled <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Families in Houſes</hi> in his time.</p>
               <p>§. Both Presbyters and Independents willingly oblige themſelves to no form, being againſt all ſet forms, but leaving themſelves at large in all their Adminiſtrations. Our Supream Governours, as in duty bound, preſcribe and enjoyn, as in our Liturgy, the daily teaching of the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, that all his Subjects may be ſure to have them ſincerely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced unto them. If there be no form for diſpencing of them, how can the Prince be ſure that they are rightly diſpenced and taught? nay, how can he be ſure that they are taught at all? and if not certain thereof, how can he give to God a good and ſure account, that they were ſincerely taught, or that the <hi>Alcoran Talmude</hi> or <hi>Trent Creed</hi> were not taught inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? If our <hi>Liturgy</hi> be daily uſed, the very ſolemn days which by Antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Church</hi> are to be celebrated, for the Commemoration of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity, Advent</hi> of our Saviour, his <hi>Nativity, Circumciſion, Paſſion, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſſention,</hi> will ſo preſerve theſe things among the Common People, that is ſcarcely imaginable that they should be ſo groſly ignorant as not to have explicite knowledge of thoſe myſteries of Chriſt, ſo publickly and frequently ſolemnized in the <hi>Church:</hi> The want of which <hi>Liturgy,</hi> hath in theſe late times ushered in much ignorance, even of the neceſſary fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and made a wide Gap for ignorance, nay, Atheiſm, not only to creep, but to leap in amongſt us. How many Congregations or Parishes wanted the Holy Communion, for the greater part of twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the late times? now who was to blame, or reſponſible to God for ſo hainous a ſin as the keeping back the Bread of Life, the Incumbent or the Civil Magiſtrate or both? and who was in fault when it was afterwards given, yet to thoſe only that would ſit, and take it at a long Table (deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to others, that deſired to receive it in the moſt reverend man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by kneeling) the Incumbent or the Magiſtrate that might have ruled it otherwaies, thereby excommunicating in their ſence at leaſt with exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>a Sacris;</hi> all the Parish at one breath, ſave a few? What could his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Infallible Holineſs at</hi> Rome have done more imperiouſly, then to deny the Bread of Life to thoſe that would not ſubmit to their <hi>ipſe dixit.</hi> The hainouſneſs of this crime of robbing whole Parishes of the Lords own Supper, Table, Cup, Body and Blood, for ſo many years together, in our late times, is abundantly ſet forth, atteſted and proved to be from Popish Principles in a Book entituled, <hi>A new Diſcovery of ſome Romiſh Emiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. The ſum then of the Conteſt will be between <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Presbyterian Independant</hi> or <hi>Popiſh,</hi> matters not much. They being in the point of Domination, not much different, only the <hi>Independant</hi> is moſt moderate, and the <hi>Pope</hi> moſt exorbitant, extending his Supremacy and Juriſdiction over forrain Princes, and beyond his own Territories, even to the Excommunication, nay, Depoſition of Kings, and how much leſs the Presbyter claims, <hi>Sa. Rutherford in the forenamed Book and his (if I may call it his) Book called</hi> Lex Rex <hi>do</hi> ſpeak, and as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the ſame, ſo the ſame Anſwer will reach them all.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50679:35"/>
               <p>§. The Prieſts conceive by their mandate, <hi>viz. Go teach all Nations Baptizing,</hi> &amp;c. received from Chriſt, Independant of any earthly Power, that they have by vertue thereof Authority to put in execution that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. In their opinion to preach and pray, what when and where they pleaſe, Adminiſter the Sacraments after what form and manner ſeems beſt unto every of them, though never ſo different one from the other, uſe any form of Diſcipline, excommunicate whom and when they pleaſe, and all this without being accomptable to any earthly power, or having any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior over them.</p>
               <p>§. The Prince on the other ſide, though he pretend not to Preach, Baptiſe, impoſe hands, adminiſter Sacraments, uſe the Keys, or the like, yet deems it more particularly and more eſpecially within his Province, to take care of <hi>theſe Priests</hi> and <hi>Priestly things,</hi> to ſee that the Perſons be able, and well quallified, and that they execute the Mandat according to the Doctrine of Faith, and of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. And as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and maintain theſe that do perform their Function accordingly, ſo to ſilence and puniſh thoſe that do not, elſe why ſhould he be blamed for giving liberty to a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Phanatick Quaker,</hi> more than unto an <hi>Independant</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. A <hi>King</hi> is he that Ruleth others, and the relation of the Word doth teach us, that there can be no <hi>King</hi> but in reſpect of his Subjects, and his duty towards them is to direct, to command, and puniſh, in all things needful. Where God chargeth the <hi>King, to keep and obſerve all the words of the Law</hi> keeping and obſerving are not there referred to his private Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a Man, but to his publick Functions as a <hi>King;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Kings,</hi> in theſe words, received the charg and overſight of the whole Law, that is, an expreſs command from God, to ſee the Law kept, and every part thereof obſerved of all men within his Dominions; and the breakers of it, <hi>Prophets, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to be puniſhed. Now the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all things that any way touched the true Service and Worſhip of God, and therefore the <hi>Kings</hi> had one and the ſelf ſame power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and puniſh as well in the Precepts of Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty, as other points of Policy, neither did God favour or proſper any of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> but ſuch as chiefly reſpected and carefully maintained the Ordinances of Religion preſcribed unto them in <hi>Moſes Law.</hi> This Power is granted to belong to Princes, even by ſome <hi>Papists themſelves,</hi> witneſs that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and learned Servite <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> throughout his Hiſtory of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, <q>where he complains and avers that amongſt the perverſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (of which this our unhappy Age is full) this alſo is preached, that the care of Religion doth not belong to the Prince; that in other times <hi>Holy Biſhops</hi> did not preach nor recommend any thing more to <hi>Princes</hi> than the care of Religion, they warned them of nothing, nor modeſtly rebuked them for any thing more than for their careleſneſs in it. And now nothing is more preached than that, to the <hi>Prince</hi> belongeth not the charge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, though contrariwiſe the Holy Scripture be full of places, wherein Religion is commended to the protection of <hi>Princes</hi> by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, which alſo promiſeth Peace and Proſperity to thoſe States where Piety is ſavoured, and Deſolation and Deſtruction threatned to thoſe States wherein Divine things are held as Alien.</q> 
                  <hi>David</hi> though being entred into a Kingdom out of Order, both internally and externally, and being very buſie both in Wars, and framing a politick Government, yet did ſet his chief care on matters of Religion; <hi>Solomon</hi> entring into a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50679:36"/>quiet and exceeding well ordered Kingdom, regarded alſo Religion more than any other part of the Government. The Princes moſt applauded in former Ages, as <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Charlemain,</hi> St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and others made it their chief care, and travail to protect and rule the Affairs of the <hi>Church.</hi> It is a great deceit to ſet forth this part as a thing of leſs moment ſince the neglect of this doth provoke the divine wrath: experience tells that a State cannot ſtand untroubled where change of Religion cometh, for that <hi>true Religion is the foundation of States. He that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt ruling in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. <hi>It is an abomination to Kings to commit wickedneſs, for the Throne is establiſhed by righteouſneſs,</hi> 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.14. It were a great abſurdity to leave the total care of it to others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that they are ſpiritual, where temporal Authority will not reach, or that a Prince hath any greater charge or imployment than this.</p>
               <p>§. As it is manifeſt that the Prince is not <hi>Pretor,</hi> nor <hi>Prefect,</hi> nor <hi>Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi> no nor <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Biſhop:</hi> So it is as true, that he is to overſee and cauſe them to do their duties, both the one and the other. And here lieth the deceit, that the particular care of Religion is proper to the Officers of the <hi>Church,</hi> as the Civil Government is to the Prince, who ought to do neither the one nor the other, but is to direct all, and to take heed that none do fail in his Office. This being the Princes charge, as well in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion as in any other part of the Government: And as in other matters, the <hi>Prince</hi> is to be informed of all occurrences, ſo ought he to be particularly advertiſed of all that happeneth in matters of Religion. And I conceive that therefore a Prince is more bound than a private Subject, to fear, and to ſerve God, to be both zealous, and jealous of his holy Faith, to honour, cheriſh, and defend Gods <hi>true Church;</hi> that he (as <hi>Pope Eleutherius</hi> writ to <hi>King Lucius</hi>) being <hi>Chriſts Vicar,</hi> in his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould diſcharge Chriſts Place and Commands; and alſo more bound to avoid Hypocriſie, Superſtition, and all open and ſcandalous ſins, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Dignity, and maintain his State and Royalty in the exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Becauſe <hi>Regis exemplum in numerabiles populos catervatim ſecum ducit,</hi> and leaſt that happen to his People, which ſometime fell out to the Jews through <hi>Moſes</hi> long abſence, who thinking that in him they were deprived of the true God, made themſelves one of Gold.</p>
               <p>§. It is agreed by all, That God hath not left humane Nature deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſuch remedies as are neceſſary to its conſervation; and that Rule and Dominion being neceſſary to the conſervation where that Rule and Dominion is granted, there all things neceſſary for the ſupport of that Rule and Dominion are granted alſo. It is farther granted alſo, that ſupreme power ought to be entire and undivided, and cannot elſe be ſufficient for the protection of all, if it do not extend over all, without any other equal power to controul or diminiſh it: and that therefore the ſupreme Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magiſtrate ought to command Eccleſiaſtical perſons as well as Civil. Look back a little into the old Teſtament, and conſider the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> and <hi>Republick,</hi> of which the Lord himſelf doth teſtify 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. <hi>That his people hath Statutes and Laws ſo juſt and wiſe, that the Inſtitutes of no people,</hi> that the Sanctions of no Republick, that no Ordinances howſoever wiſely conſtitute were able to compare with them; therefore methinks, that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> ſhould be moſt divinely and wiſely ordered, that cometh as near as the circumſtances of the preſent matter will permit, to the Conſtitution of the Jewiſh Church and State, in which matters were ſo ordered by God, that we find not any where two diverſe Judicatories
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50679:36"/>concerning manners, the one Politick, the other Eccleſiaſtick: what then hindereth that the <hi>Church</hi> now alſo on whom God hath beſtowed a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, ſhould be leſs content with one Government. To me it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth monſtrous, to place two heads upon one body of a viſible <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe Commands, Decrees and Government are divers, ſo that the rule of one, is not ſubject to the care of the other. For the Eccleſiaſtical Senate or Presbytery would have the Supream Power of Puniſhing Vices, even in Magiſtrates themſelves, though not with <hi>Corporal Puniſhment</hi> yet with <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and debatring them from the Sacraments, whereas one Magiſtrate appointed by God may now as well bridle all tranſgreſſions as he could of old; was it not ſo in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which was as it were a Type of <hi>Christs Church</hi> reigning on this Earth? And I do not find either under <hi>Moſes</hi> or under the <hi>Judges</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi> or under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe which were called <hi>Rulers,</hi> ſuch two diſcrepant Judicatories. Nature denies ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> two Authentick Governments in the ſame People, whereof one is not ſubject to the other. It is manifeſt that <hi>David</hi> did diſpoſe of all Offices and Miniſters of the <hi>Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 22.27. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Solomon</hi> did not only build but <hi>conſecrate</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> and not a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Hitherto belongeth that famous Hiſtory of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> in the 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19. which doth perfectly clear this cauſe, as alſo doth the Hiſtory of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> and indeed the whole Old Teſtament. It is too well known, that though <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> do allow ſomething to ſecular Magiſtrates in the Rule of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet the Supremacy of Power they do utterly and in very terms deny. And having obtained poſſeſſion of power in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that (as they hold out) <hi>by Christs own inſtitution,</hi> they are very loath to reſign the ſame again at the demand, and into the hands of Princes. It is true, that when our Saviour firſt gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples, to Preach, Baptize and Propogate the true Faith in the World; ſecular Authority being univerſally averſe thereunto, he was of neceſſity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for the preſent, both Doctrines and Diſcipline to the charge of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yet not without a promiſe: That <hi>Kings ſhould be their Nurſing Fathers, and Queens the Nurſing Mothers of his Church,</hi> who though now they are come in, and become friendly to Religion, and willing to advance the ſpiritual proſperity of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as of the Temporal of the State, yet both Papiſts and Presbyters having got poſſeſſion are loath to be diſquietted, dreaming of a Spiritual Empire belonging to Prieſts, more worthy and Sacred than that of the Emperors, and ſo ſecretly preferring the <hi>Croſier</hi> before the <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. Power and Government are things moſt awful, and honourable, and the trueſt owners thereof next under God are Princes, whom the true le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimat <hi>Church,</hi> ever looked upon as Cods immediate Vicegerents, Deputies and Governours thereof. St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2. Writing to the <hi>Church,</hi> in the time of a <hi>Heathen and Impious Emperor commandeth every Soul to be Subject to the higher Powers.</hi> He acknowlegeth power in a very <hi>Nero,</hi> and that to be the higher Power. And to that Power of that <hi>Nero,</hi> he ſubjects every ſoul, Chriſtian and Heathen, <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Layman,</hi> and it may not ſeem ſtrange that meer Power and Rule, in an unbeliever and wicked <hi>Prince,</hi> ſhould be ſo ſacred and inviolable. We muſt take notice that the wickedneſs of Princes in ill Commands, though it diſcharge us as to thoſe ill Commands, yet it doth not diſcharge their power or Rule either in thoſe or any other. For when Princes rule well, they are to be obeyed, when ill they are to be endured, and this very endurance is an effect of obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50679:37"/>The violence of this or that <hi>Nero</hi> may be Tyrannous; but the lawful Authority whereby the ſame violence is done, is not Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Office of <hi>Kings</hi> the leſs Glorious, becauſe they can uſe force nor yet that of Miniſters the more Glorious, becauſe they may uſe none but perſwaſive Motives and Allurements. For Power it ſelf being a Glorious Divine thing, it muſt be moſt honourable to uſe it in Gods Cauſe, and his Glory, and the advance and increaſe of his Flock and Kingdom, and therefore we ſee <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and other good <hi>Kings</hi> are commended for uſing <hi>compulſion,</hi> and on the contrary other Kings which uſed it not for the ſuppreſſing of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, removing the high places and the like, did draw curſes on themſelves and their ſubjects. And whereas it is objected by <hi>I. M.</hi> and others, <hi>that Force and Compulſion, reſtrain only from the act of ſin, but not the Will from the liking thereof, and that to compel outward profeſſion, is to compel Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, not to advance Religion.</hi> But we ſee common experience teacheth us better effects thereof. For <hi>Scotland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, England,</hi> &amp;c. ſuffered great changes of Religion in a ſhort ſpace, and theſe changes were wrought by the force of Civil Magiſtrates, and could never elſe, without ſtrange Miracles from Heaven have been ſo ſoon compaſſed, and theſe Changes have not proved the leſs ſincere, becauſe Civil Authority wrought them, as the <hi>Samaritan firſt believed Chriſt on the Womans word, but then for his own ſake,</hi> ſo thoſe that were compelled to the Wedding, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes, which came to our <hi>Churches,</hi> firſt to ſave their Purſes, afterwards came out of liking, of which the <hi>Pope</hi> being advertiſed forbad it, and made it a <hi>Signum Diſtinctivum.</hi> Its a ſhrewd ſign that that Babe is ſpurious, which the Mother is aſhamed to bring to light, and that is Falſhood and Droſs, not Truth and Gold, which dares not abide any Teſt, and that thoſe Maſſes are not of a Divine Origine, that muſt be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in an unknown Tongue; and truſted only with the Prieſts who are parties to the Cheat.</p>
               <p>Beſides the means uſed in all Laws of God and man to induce obedience, are <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments,</hi> both which may occaſion <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man is as inclinable to diſſemble Religion which he believes not, as well for hope of reward as for fear of puniſhment, which is <hi>vitio perſonae non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mii vel poenae,</hi> elſe God would not have appointed them as mounds of his laws and motives of obedience. The pious example of a good King is of mervelous inducement towards Religion, yet one may hypocritically diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Religion to pleaſe his Prince. Example is ſo powerful a motive that it is ſaid to <hi>compel,</hi> 2 <hi>Gal.</hi> 14. <hi>Peccant magiſtratus cum minis &amp; paenis alios peccare non prohibent.</hi> 13 <hi>Nehem.</hi> 17.21.22.

               <p>§. Authority it ſelf hath not ſo rigorous a ſway over the ſouls of men, as to obtrude diſliked Religions univerſally, it muſt perſwade as well as compel, and convince as well as command, or elſe great alterations cannot eaſily and ſuddenly be perfected. And in this reſpect Proclamations, of Princes, and commanding Edicts moſtly prove more efficacious Sermons
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50679:37"/>than thoſe from out of the Pulpits; look back on former times and it is evident that before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> favoured Religion the Goſpel ſpread but ſlowly, and that not without a wondeful confluence of Heavenly Signs and Miracles wrought by our Saviour and his Diſciples; all which we may probably conjecture had never been in ſuch plentiful manner mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the World, had it not been to countervail the enmity and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſecular Authority. And it may be conjectured, nay preſumed, that had the <hi>Caeſars</hi> heartily by command, and example joyned in the propagation of Chriſts Doctrine, more might have been effected towards the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel by their Cooperation, than all <hi>Christs Apostles Biſhops</hi> and other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> did effect by their extraordinary gifts and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments; we ſee alſo that <hi>Conſtantines Converſion</hi> was of more moment and did more conduce to the proſperity and propagation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, than all the labours and endeavours of thouſands of <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which before had attempted the ſame. We ſee <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. though a Minor, in a ſhort time very much diſpelled the miſts of Popiſh errors and ſuperſtition, and when no men were more averſe to the truth than the Clergy, yet he ſet up the banner thereof in all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and redeemed millions of ſouls from the thraldom of Hell and <hi>Rome.</hi> So <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> though a ſingle woman was a moſt admirable inſtrument in the ſame deſign, and what ſhe did in <hi>England,</hi> other Princes did the like in their Dominions, whatſoever was effected by the labour of Miniſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviour, the ſame if not greater matters were ſooner expedited by the ordinary Power and Wiſdome of Princes, when Miniſters were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally oppoſite thereunto. And as we ſee the ſpiritual power of Princes, how ſtrangely prevalent it is for the truth, ſo we ſee moſt woful effects thereof againſt the truth: Religion was not ſooner reformed by <hi>E.</hi> 6. than it was deformed again by <hi>Q. M.</hi> And although many godly Miniſters were here then ſetled as appears by the numerous Martyrs, yet all thoſe Miniſters could not uphold Religion with all their labours and hands, ſo ſtrongly as <hi>Q. M.</hi> could ſubvert it with the leaſt of her Fingers; one fierce <hi>King of Spain</hi> bound himſelf in a <hi>curſed Oath</hi> to maintain the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate all contrary Doctrines out of his confines, which taking effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, It demonſtrates and confirms that one <hi>Kings Enmity</hi> or ſupineneſs towards Religion, is more pernitious than a thouſand Miniſters zeal is or can be advantagious to the ſpreading of the Goſpel, which conſequence alone ought to ſway and prevail very much with Princes to act very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and very circumſpectly in matters of Religion, as being moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to accompt for it, and for that their countenance or diſcountenance of the true or falſe Religion, of ſin or piety, is next unto or a kind of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the one or the other by a Law according to that antient received Maxim. <hi>Regis ad exemplum, totus componitur Orbis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the examples of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>chief Magiſtrates</hi> being of ſuch wonderful avail, and indeed of more conſequence than 20000 Pulpits, no doubt if they would put in practice and follow the example of <hi>King Davids</hi> reſolution in the 101 Pſal. <hi>to walk in their Houſes with a perfect heart, to behave themſelves wiſely in a perfect way, to ſet no wicked thing before their eyes, to hate the work of them that turn aſide, not to know a wicked perſon,</hi> to ſhew no favour, to give no countenance, no preferment, to any wicked perſon; <hi>but to let their eyes be upon the faithful of the Land, and on them that excel in virtue, that they may dwell with them, and that they,</hi> and only they <hi>that walk in a perfect way do ſerve them, that they that work deceit ſhould
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50679:38"/>not dwell in their Houſes, nor they that tell lies tarry in their Sght.</hi> No doubt I ſay, but ſuch Princes by ſuch pious practices and examples, would by ſuch diſcountenancing of Sin and Sinners quickly deſtroy the wicked of the Land, and cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord, and would conduce much even to the making of a <hi>high way of holineſs throughout the Land, that wayfaring Men though Fools might noterre therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For who knoweth not that example doth as certainly kill Souls, as Fire and Fagot do bodies, and that an exemplary life of Men in Authority doth incline and invite their Subjects and Servants to the ſame, whether it be holy or unholy, more, much more than Pulpits, or any verbal Rhetorick. St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not Preach <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> but only for fear of offending, the Jews <hi>did forbear to eat with the Gentiles,</hi> yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth him for it to his face, and interpreteth that fact of his as an effective and almoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive ſeducement, <hi>Cogis Judaizare?</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 14. <hi>Why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to Judaize?</hi> ſo <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13. <hi>c. v.</hi> 17. Contended with the <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day?</hi> and yet the Rulers had not ſinned by perſonal commiſſion, but by <hi>partial Connivence</hi> and toleration of the ſins of others. Beſides it is not the Clergy only that is ſo immediately and ſo univerſally reſponſable for the publick diſcountenancing of Religion (being chiefly reſponſable for their particular Flocks only) for even the abuſes of the very Clergy it ſelf, will one day be ſet on the Magiſtrates account, and according to that vaſt ſpiritual Power which God hath put into the hands of Princes, ſo will God certainly require at their hands.</p>
               <p>§. Preaching is not the only means of Salvation, nor Miniſters the only Preachers, nor Sacraments only efficacious, becauſe the Clergy only may adminiſter them. Though <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> call themſelves only, <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual perſons,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Lot of Chriſt,</hi> and put <hi>Princes</hi> into the number of <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Laymen</hi> and limit them to ſecular things, yet God will not be ſo mocked, they ought to acknowledge the character of Divinity, which is ſo much more fairly ſtamped on Princes, than it is on them, and let them not rob Princes of that influence in ſacred things which they themſelves can never enjoy. For as Princes muſt anſwer for wilful or negligent permitting a wicked Clergy, ſo muſt <hi>Pope Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> anſwer for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to cajol Princes out of their Supream Power, on pretence that Gods Meſſage is ſo delivered to them. Let Miniſters aſſiſt Princes in their Spiritual and Religious Offices, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did <hi>Moſes,</hi> let them not contend for Supremacy over Cauſes and Perſons Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; but let them accompt it their moſt Supreme Service, to attend on that Supremacy, ſo ſhall more honour and ſanctity paſs from <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> and more efficacy and vertue from <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> more Grace and happineſs from both to the People.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> The main Argument uſed both by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> to raiſe the <hi>Miter</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> above the Crown, is drawn from the power of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which Sword <hi>Church men</hi> only claim, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they think they may as freely ſtrike Princes as Princes may ſtrike them with their Temporal Sword, of both which a word in general, and alſo in particular, as it relates to Princes. <hi>Excommunication,</hi> that great <hi>Popiſh and Presbyterian Thunderboult</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> of their <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> claimed to be their due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and ſo highly exalted by them that it is not more monopolized, nor advanced higher at <hi>Rome,</hi> than it would be here by them within their Precincts, if not curbed by the Civil Magiſtrate, ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50679:38"/>apt it is to be tyrannically abuſed by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> for experience tells us, that if they might have their Will, they would by virtue thereof put ſuch a <hi>Spiritual Pad-lock</hi> upon the <hi>Temporal Sword,</hi> and by their <hi>In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad Spiritualia,</hi> take ſuch faſt hold of it themſelves, that if they and <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> ſhould chance to differ, they may be ſure (ſo long as their Doctrine concerning it, will be believed) to have the drawing of it themſelves, and leave poor Chriſtian Princes to whom the Sword of Right (more antient than <hi>Papacy</hi> or <hi>John Calvins Presbytery</hi>) more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, to defend themſelves with the Scabbard, for which ſeveral of them have paid dear, witneſs amongſt others, thoſe 17 <hi>Scotiſh Miniſters,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convented before the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for holding a ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> without the Kings leave, 2. <hi>July</hi> 1605. <hi>utterly denied the Authority both of King and Council in that behalf,</hi> affirming, that in matters Eccleſiaſtical, they neither ow nor ought to acknowledge themſelves in any ſubjection either to the King or to his Council, and that all ſpiritual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhould be tryed and determined by the <hi>Church</hi> (meaning thereby themſelves the <hi>Clergy</hi>) for which cauſe and for denying the Kings Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 6 of the chief of them were arraigned and condemned at <hi>Blackneſs in Scotland January</hi> 10. 1605. and how inſolently ſome of the ſame Tribe vſed <hi>King James,</hi> more than once he himſelf hath publiſhed in Print, and their imperious exhorbitances may be read as in ſeveral other Books, ſo in <hi>Presbytery Diſplayed</hi> printed 1644. and how they uſed <hi>King Charles</hi> the firſt, <hi>I.

               <p>Some and thoſe of no ſmall eſteem in the <hi>Church</hi> are of opinion, that the exerciſe of <hi>Excommunication</hi> was then only needful, when no <hi>viſible Church</hi> had any legal or civil remedy to preſerve its unity, or purge it ſelf of groſs Offenders, or that the right or power of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which the Apoſtles and immediate Succeſſors had, did utterly expire, when once whole Cities and Common-wealths became Chriſtian, and were enabled from the Supreme Civil Magiſtrate to puniſh Offenders, and to enact coercive and penal Laws, and other means neceſſary for the ſpreading and promulgating of the Goſpel. Sure I am, that experience hath made it more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that after the <hi>Church</hi> and Common-wealths were ſo linked and interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven together, that every Member of the Common-wealth was enforced to become a Member of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to be ſo admitted by the <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> the edge of this ſpiritual Sword was very much abated, and the force of former ſpiritual Ordinances became ſtifled with the multitude of thoſe perſons againſt whom they were directed, whether the defect be in the power it ſelf or in ſuch as have, but to do not uſe it as they ought, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that this branch of diſcipline is not in our days ſo effectual, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times it hath been.</p>
               <p>The meer ſpiritual Power with which alone the Apoſtles and their Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succeſſors were endued, was of greater efficacy than both the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the like ſpiritual Power, in <hi>Dermier</hi> Biſhops and Paſtors, and all the ſtrength of ſecular Civil Power wherewith Princes States or Kingdoms ſince the mutual incorporation of Common-wealths and <hi>Churches</hi> have (as they were in conſcience and <hi>Jure Divino</hi> bound) aſſiſted Prelates and <hi>Church
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50679:39"/>Governours;</hi> of this nature ſeems to be the <hi>Apoſtolical Rod.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. wherewith <hi>Paul</hi> threatneth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whereby is meant as he explains himſelf, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.16. <hi>ch.</hi> 13.2. <hi>To uſe ſharpneſs, to revenge all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, not to ſpare,</hi> all which are expreſſions of a certain miraculous vertue of impoſſing puniſhment. Thus <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira fell down dead</hi> 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>Elymas was ſmitten with blindneſs.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Himeneus, Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Inceſtuous Corinthian were delivered to Sathan,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>§. To <hi>deliver to Sathan</hi> was plainly a point of <hi>miraculous Power</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted torment on the Body, ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> in former times felt after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God, as <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and other Fathers interpret. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when the earthly powers uſed not their right of puniſhing God had given them to purge and defend the <hi>Church,</hi> what was wanting in human aid, God himſelf ſupplied by divine aſſiſtance. After the Emperors took on them the <hi>Patronage of the Church</hi> (whoſe office was to puniſh them that troubled the <hi>Church</hi> without or within) the forenamed divine puniſhment expired. And moſt properly, that divine execution of revenge was the juriſdiction of God not of Men, becauſe the whole work was Gods, not the Apoſtles. God that he might give teſtimony to the truth of the Goſpel preached, as at the Apoſtles Prayers or preſence, or touch, he healed diſeaſes, and caſt out Divils; ſo at their imprecation commanded men to be vexed with Diſeaſes, and ſeized by Divils.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Paul</hi> more by delivering men to <hi>Satan,</hi> than did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> by curing the lame man, <hi>who ſay they did nothing by their own Power, Acts</hi> 12. and aſcribe the whole effect to God. At the Prayers alſo of the <hi>Church</hi> did God often ſhew the like ſigns of his diſpleaſure, therefore are the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. blamed that they mourned not, to the end the <hi>Inceſtuous perſon</hi> might be taken away from among them: And to the ſame effect is that wiſh, not command of the Apoſtles to the Galatians 5.12. <hi>would they were cut off that trouble you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Excommunication</hi> if it may be ſo called, was a <hi>Corporal puniſhment,</hi> and there is no appearance of any internal obduration, by the binding power of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and it was miraculous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might be of uſe then, when the <hi>Keys of Church-men could not err,</hi> and when a <hi>Temporal Sword</hi> was wanting, yet now it is utterly uſeleſs and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>§. For any other <hi>Excommunication</hi> of preſent or perpetual neceſſity in Eccleſiaſtical Regiment there is <hi>very little,</hi> indeed no plain proof in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if any at all, it is the <hi>ſpiritual Scepter</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which their Empire would appear meerly <hi>Imaginary,</hi> and therefore their Zeal is fierce and ſtrong for it, though their reaſons be weak. It ſeems to me a very obſcure and lame deduction, that the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> in the Goſpel muſt needs import <hi>real Power</hi> and juriſdiction in Clergy men, and in them only, and that that Sword is as miraculous as it was, or as uſeful as if it were miraculous, and that the ſtroak of it is meerly Spiritual, and not to be ſupplied by the Temporal Sword, and that Princes are as well liable to it, as other Laymen.</p>
               <p>§. In caſe of utter impenitency, of open and obſtinate perverſeneſs, Heaven is ſhut without the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyters Power,</hi> and in caſe of feigned penitence neither the <hi>Popes</hi> nor <hi>Presbyters Keys</hi> can open effectually, though they diſcern or diſcern not the hypocricy, and in caſe of true penitence if <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> be miſtaken, yet Heaven will not remain ſhut.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50679:39"/>
               <p>§. Some excellent writers againſt the uſurped power of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> in uſe or exerciſe of St. <hi>Peters Keys,</hi> as well before <hi>Luther</hi> as ſince, have been of opinion that the <hi>viſible Church</hi> hath only power to declare who are ſeparated or excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> from the holy Catholick Church, and that ſhe hath no power ſo to ſeparate or excommunicate any, unleſs they have firſt excommunicated themſelves, or voided their hopes or intereſts in the holy Catholick Church, by heretical poſitions or opinions, or by lewd and ſcandalous miſdemeanors. Of this opinion was that famous <hi>Weſſelius</hi> which was intituled <hi>Lux Mundi</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, or the ſo pure Light of the Goſpel which we now enjoy.</p>
               <p>Beſides Divines themſelves have not hitherto agreed, nor are ever like to agree, what this <hi>excommunication</hi> is, or what the extent of it is, or whether the Presbyter alone, or joyned with the Laity, or Lait without the <hi>Presbyter</hi> have power to execute it, or whether it be ſo ſpiritually inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as that they can or cannot depute the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to Deligates or Proxies. In theſe great ſtraights and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties concerning <hi>excommunication,</hi> held out to be of ſuch high concern, as to make the excommunicated as it were accurſed and cut off from the <hi>Church,</hi> what ſhall poor Laicks do? who are well aſſured, that be their Commiſſion what it will, that it extends not to impower them to teach and much leſs to impoſe any Doctrines, but what are undoubtedly and meerly true, the Apoſtles themſelves pretending to no other.</p>
               <p>§. Some endeavour to ſupport this feigned pillar of their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by Arguments drawn from the Jewiſh manner of excommunication, which according to ſome was twofold, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> called <hi>Niddui,</hi> and was only a temporary ſeparation commonly for 30 dayes, from all commerce or ſociety with any man within a certain diſtance. This is it which is thought to be that which is called in the New Teſtament a caſting out of the Synagogue, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The ſecond more ſevere and terrible than the former was, when a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous oſſender with curſes out of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the publick audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> without any limitation of time, was excluded from the Communion of it. This is that which is thought to be that which is called in the New Teſtament, <hi>a delivering up unto Sathan,</hi> in Hebrew this is called <hi>Cherim</hi> and in Greek <hi>Anathema,</hi> which was twofold, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Simple when what I have now mentioned was performed, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. with an addition of <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> or as the <hi>Syrian</hi> pronounce it <hi>Moranetho,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other maledictions out of the Law, they added this clauſe, <hi>Our Lord cometh,</hi> by which form the excommunicated perſon as deſperate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of pardon or reſtitution was left unto the Lord, to receive from him a heavy doom at his coming. In imitation of this Jewiſh excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which generally is defined by almoſt all to be an excluſion of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and Communion of Believers, the Popiſh Divines have alſo framed 2 kinds of <hi>excommunication,</hi> viz. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A leſſer, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the greater, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, That the excommunicated is to be debarred not from the profeſſion of the ſame Faith, nor from giving his conſent to the ſame Doctrine with the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> whereof he is a viſible Member but from the ſoel partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacraments, have added alſo another which they term the greater <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Anathema,</hi> and have againſt the clear ſence of Scripture (I wiſh the Presbyterians could herein plead not guilty) defined it to be an interdiction of Churches private commerce, and all other lawful converſe, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. openly ſheweth, that neither the heathen nor any perſon whatſoever were forbidden from hearing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50679:40"/>word, from the Reading, Thankſgivings and Prayers of Chriſtians And I have not found extant in the Scripture any Precept or Example whereby it is commanded or taught, that they who err only in life and manners ſhould be removed from the Sacraments. I do not read that any perſon at any time amongſt the Jews was for ſuch cauſes forbid by the <hi>Priests, Levites, Prophets, Scribes</hi> or <hi>Pharaſes,</hi> to come unto the Sacrifices Ceremonies or Sacraments. The high Prieſts eſteemed <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> moſt wicked perſons, yet we do not find that during Chriſts life or after his death, that ever they went about to debar them of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sacrifices inſtituted by God; they reprehended indeed Chriſt for eating and drinking with Publicans and Sinners, but not for praying in the Temple with them, nor for going up with them and all others to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to celebrate the Paſſover; neither did they debar any Publican Jew, no nor the moſt cruel <hi>Hereticks</hi> the <hi>Sadduces</hi> from their Temple or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but permitted them the honour to aſcend the high <hi>Prieſt-hood;</hi> and I do not indeed well ſee how the <hi>Priests</hi> could <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>Scandalous ſinners</hi> from eating of the Paſſover if they would, for that they did not eat before the <hi>Priests,</hi> but in their private Houſes; and I have not obſerved that the preſence of a <hi>Priest</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary to that matter. And certainly if the law had permitted them to debar any from their Sacraments and Sacrifices but the Leprous and unclean, they would certainly have debarred Chriſt and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> ſuch was their deſperate and inveterate malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him and them, preſuming his deſign to have been to deſtroy their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. Upon theſe and other like reaſons and grounds, there are ſome who do not ſtick to affirm that the <hi>Clergy</hi> hath not ſo much power to <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> the <hi>Laity</hi> as the <hi>Laity</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> all power being given to the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> thereof, to govern it ſelf, and that there is no other excommunication then what is common to both, <hi>viz. To withdraw our ſelves from every Brother that walketh diſorderly,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>If any obey not our ſaying, have no company with him, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, v.</hi> 34. <hi>not to eat with the Brother, that is a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Rayler, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>and put away from amongſt you that evil perſon, v.</hi> 13. All which precepts belong to all both <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> indifferently. Let excommunication be what it will (if any there be.)</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the Diſcourſe alſo of the Reformation of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> a Congregation was ordained on purpoſe to conſult and find a means that <hi>Princes</hi> might not <hi>intermeddle in the Conclave</hi> in the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Pope;</hi> ſo jealous and unwilling are they to have any Laick, great or ſmall, to come within their Verge, their <hi>Scrinia ſacra,</hi> or to intermeddle in such their Concerns, though they have none <hi>de Jure,</hi> (but their Prieſthood) but what they have either obtained by Power, or uſurped by Fraud, or by the Supineneſs or Favours of Pious Princes.</p>
               <p>But when ſome of the Council thought in order to Reformation, to make a Conſtitution, that no <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould have any <hi>Temporal Offices</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Dominions,</hi> that, even that alſo would be a great <hi>prejudice</hi> to the <hi>Eccleſiasticks</hi> of <hi>France, Polonia,</hi> and of other Countries and Kingdoms where they are <hi>Councellors of Kings,</hi> and have the <hi>Principal Offices,</hi> of which they would ſoon be deprived by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Secular Nobility, for their own Intereſts, and therefore that String was not to be touched upon, but left unto the Popes order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Biſhop of St. Mark,</hi> in the Diſpute about the Title of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> had the boldneſs to aver that the <hi>Laicks</hi> are moſt improperly called the <hi>Church;</hi> for that the <hi>Canons</hi> determine that <hi>they have no Authority to command, but Neceſſity to obey;</hi> and that the Council ought to Decree that the Seculars ought humbly to receive the Doctrine of Faith, which is given them by the <hi>Church,</hi> without diſputing or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, <hi>Petro Soave Polano</hi> 141. That is in <hi>Romiſh</hi> underſtanding, that that Religion which the Pope (Obedience unto him, being made by them a true Mark of the <hi>Church</hi>) doth pleaſe to give them, ought to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Laicks</hi> without diſpute. What is this elſe, but plainly and groſly to mock the world, and to think all men <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Cuddens</hi> but themſelves, and to perſwade themſelves that all their <hi>Abſurdities</hi> ſhould be believed without more ado? What is this leſs than to perſwade Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men that they are Bruits, Horſes or Aſſes, void of all underſtanding? or that hearing, they do not hear; or that ſeeing, they do not ſee; or that perceiving, they do not underſtand. <hi>Qui vult decipi decipiatur.</hi>

               <p>§. Thus have I unto the meaneſt Capacities made plain and evident both by Precept and Practice out of the Word of Truth, the Title and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which the whole <hi rend="blackletterType">Congregation of Believers</hi> have unto the <hi>Appellation</hi> and <hi>Powers.</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and unto Eccleſiaſtical Concerns, without wreſting or perverting any one Text of Scripture.</p>
               <p>§. Now the <hi>Pope</hi> would very much oblige us, if he would vouchſafe unto us but only one plain Text to warrant the Powers he exerciſeth and lays claim unto over the Laity, or how he comes to be ſo eſſential to the <hi>Church,</hi> as to be put into the very definition thereof: It being plain downright non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (if it be good manners to ſay ſo) to aver that any one ſingle perſon alone, how great ſoever, can ſuffice to make a <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Congregation:</hi> for that at leaſt two or three are neceſſarily required to make an Aſſembly or Congregation. <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> even in its Natural and Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conſtruction, ſignifying a Plurality or Multitude, be it Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical. And as it is a new, ſo it is an <hi>abſurd kind of Trope,</hi> deviſed by the <hi>Romanists</hi> to make the <hi>Pope,</hi> a ſingle perſon, to <hi>ſignifie</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi> I know the <hi>Papalins</hi> are moſt excellent Artiſts, moſt rare <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing even thoſe our Brethren <hi>Roſeae Crucis,</hi> who are modeſt <hi>Mountibanks</hi> in reſpect of theſe <hi>Audaces Jeſuitae;</hi> for they took the whole Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to found their Phanatick <hi>Chymaeraes</hi> upon; but theſe can extract their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies out of two or three words only, <hi>viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſures him that it is ſo: for that Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Paſce</hi> i.e. <hi>Regio more Impera,</hi> Play the <hi>Rex</hi> at pleaſure. In the ancient Church, when any <hi>Hereſie</hi> diſturbed the Truth, and publick Peace, a grave Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Biſhops and others were called, and the Book of God fairly laid open before them, and out of it were all Doubts determined. Now Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Councils are needleſs. Will the Pope be ſupreme Judge of all Controverſies?<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> De Rom. Pontif. <hi>C. 1. C. 3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinks the Claim to be well grounded upon this <hi>Paſce, Joh.</hi> 21.17. And it is a great wonder in his Judgment that the <hi>Pope</hi> was never thought infallible till this laſt age, ſince this <hi>Paſce</hi> implies this alſo ſo clearly, and if the Hereticks do not believe that his Holineſs hath power to make new Articles of Faith, and when they cry ſhame upon <hi>Pope Pius the Fourth</hi> for adding <hi>Twelve new Articles</hi> to the old Apoſtles Creed, it is becauſe they are ignorant, and know not what <hi>Paſce</hi> ſignifieth. In ſum, this one Word, with them contains more Matter than all the Bible beſides. It works Miracles, makes the <hi>Pope</hi> omnipotent, gives him all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not only in Heaven, and on Earth, but even in <hi>Purgatory</hi> (a place that God knows nothing of) for if you ask by what Authority he takes upon him to pardon Sins and Souls after Death, to give or ſell the Saints Merits, to diſpence with Oaths, to depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe of their Kingdoms, or if he liſt, to murder them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you look the Popes Lexicon (as Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> well obſerves) you ſhall find that <hi>Paſce</hi> expreſly denotes all this Authority, and enables him to be not only a Prince, or a Paſtor, or Biſhop, but even a Butcher too by the ſelf-ſame Logick; for what is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Kings, and that by <hi>Mariana</hi> his <hi>quacunque arte,</hi> leſs than ſavage Butchery?

But to return; The Eſteem and Powers allotted to the <hi>Brethren</hi> or body of the Church by the Apoſtles, they did preſerve unto themſelves above 250 years after Chriſt, which is very plain and manifeſt by the abundant Teſtimony of the moſt Antient Fathers and Old Canons, as by <hi>Clement</hi> Firſt <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> who lived in or near the Apoſtles days; by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived in the Third Century, with divers others: but becauſe to cite the whole <hi>Caravan</hi> of Witneſſes at large, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, would make this very Paragraph ſwell into a Volume, I forbear, and ſhall only gently touch ſome of them hereafter, that by them you may gueſs at the reſt.</p>
               <p>§. As in the firſt and pureſt times, the Name and Title of <hi>Church</hi> was common to all Congregations and Societies of Believers; ſo unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, according to all antient Records, did belong alſo the Uſe and Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the <hi>Goods</hi> which were called <hi>Eccleſiastical;</hi> in which times the poor and the Miniſters had their Food and Rayment from one common <hi>Fund</hi> or <hi>Bank;</hi> and (which is obſervable) thoſe were more principally provided for than theſe. But not long after, this excellent Uſe was perverted by the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the poor put in the loweſt place; which according to the former Uſe, ought to have continued in the firſt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And when the Name of the <hi>Church</hi> became appropriated to the <hi>Clergy</hi> only, all other Chriſtians being excluded, then that was applied to few, which belonged to all, and that to the rich, which firſt ſerved for the poor. In the beginning of thoſe Times, the <hi>Clergy</hi> having divided among themſelves all the Revenues of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Charges which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were, and were called <hi>Ministeries</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Spiritual Care, the Temporalty and Profits being now moſt eſteemed, were now called <hi>Beneſices;</hi> and ſo long as the <hi>Old Canons</hi> remained, that one man ſhould not be Ordained unto <hi>Two Titles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Titulus</hi> was the Old Word for a <hi>Church,</hi> Many Ages after Chriſt. A Biſhoprick (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was divided into Pariſhes) was called <gap reason="foreign">

And for many Ages there were no Tithes paid or due, but the Church and Clergy were maintained by the Oblations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe by the old Canons divided into four parts.</note> none could have more than one <hi>Benefice.</hi> But the Revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Wars or Inundations diminiſhed, and become not ſufficient for their Maintenance, one Man might hold two; yet ſo as that he ſhould attend them both. This was begun, in favour not of the <hi>Man Beneſiced,</hi> but of the <hi>Church,</hi> which becauſe it could not have a proper <hi>Minister,</hi> might have at leaſt ſome other Service, upon pretence of the inſufficiency of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, and that none could be found to ſerve in them, they began to grant more of them unto one, though no neceſſity appeared for the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of the <hi>Churches;</hi> and the Mask being taken away by little and little, they were not aſhamed to do it for the <hi>Man Beneſiced.</hi> But the World being ſcandalized thereat, there was a Moderation uſed; whereupon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50679:48"/>began of <hi>Men tied to Reſidence, and not tied,</hi> and of <hi>Beneſices compatible</hi> and <hi>not compatible;</hi> calling thoſe of Reſidency <hi>incompatible</hi> one with another,<note place="margin">Trattato delle materie beneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarie, <hi>144 145, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and the other <hi>compatible</hi> with theſe and with themſelves; yet the Gloſs of the Canoniſt (to make a ſhew at leaſt of Honeſty) always declared that many Benefices ſhould not be given to one, but when one is not ſufficient for maintenance. But they cut this <hi>Sufficiency</hi> very large, proportioning it not to the Perſon, but to the Quality; not eſteeming it ſufficient for an ordinary Prieſt, if it were not enough for himſelf, the Family of his Parents, three Servants, and an Horſe, and more, if he were Noble and Learned. And it is ſtrange how much they allowed for a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Decorum</hi> he was to keep.

                  </note> that no Revenue is too much for them, except it be more than enough for a <hi>King.</hi> The Cuſtom being begun, and neither the World nor Equity being able to reſiſt it, the <hi>Popes</hi> reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves power to diſpence with the Incompatible, and to have more than two of the other. But to find a colourable way to put this in practice, they laid hold on <hi>Commendaes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commendaes.</note> a thing inſtituted at firſt to good purpoſe, but after uſed to this end only. For when by reaſon of Wars, Peſtilence, and other ſuch Cauſes, the Election or Proviſion could not be made ſo ſoon, the Superiour did recommend the <hi>vacant Church</hi> to ſome honeſt and worthy man to take care of it, beſides the care of his own, until a <hi>Rector</hi> were provided, who then had nothing to do with the Revenues, but to govern them, and conſign them to another. In progreſs of Time the <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> not without divers pretences of Honeſty and Neceſſity, made uſe of the Fruits; and to enjoy them the longer, ſought means to hinder the Proviſion. For remedy whereof, Order was taken that the <hi>Commenda</hi> ſhould not laſt longer than <hi>ſix Months;</hi> but the <hi>Popes</hi> by the plenitude of their Power, did paſs theſe Limits, and commended for a longer time, and at length for the Life of the <hi>Commendataries,</hi> giving him power to uſe the Fruits, beſides the neceſſary Charges. This good Invention, ſo degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was uſed in the corrupted times for a Cloak of Pluralities; obſerving the words of the Law to give but one <hi>Benefice</hi> to one Man, contrary to the Sence, in regard that a <hi>Commendatary for Life</hi> is the ſame in reality with the <hi>Titular.</hi> Great Exorbitancies were committed in the number of the <hi>Benefices Commended,</hi> ſo that after the <hi>Lutheran Stirs</hi> began, and all men demanded Reformation, <hi>Clement the Seventh,</hi> in the Year 1534. was not aſhamed to commend unto his <hi>Nephew</hi> Hippolitus, <hi>Cardinal</hi> de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis <hi>all the Benefices of the World, Secular and Regular Dignities, and Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages ſimple,</hi> and with cure, being vacant, for <hi>Six Months,</hi> to begin from the firſt day of his poſſeſſion, with power to diſpoſe of and convert to his uſe all the Fruits. This exorbitancy was the height of all, which in former times the <hi>Court</hi> did not uſe, though it gave in <hi>Commenda</hi> a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unto one. Therefore the Union formerly invented and uſed for a good end, was now made uſe of to palliate <hi>Plurality.</hi> This was practiſed when a <hi>Church</hi> was deſtroyed, or the Revenues uſurped, that little which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, together with the Charge, being transferred to the next, and all made one Benefice, the Induſtry of the <hi>Courtier</hi> found out, that beſides theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, Benefices might be united, ſo that by <hi>Collation</hi> thereof Plurality was wholly covered, though in favour of ſome <hi>Cardinal</hi> or great Perſon 30 or 40 in divers places of Chriſtendom were united. But an Inconvenience did ariſe, becauſe a number of Beneſices did decreaſe, and the favour done to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50679:48"/>one, was afterwards done to many, without merit or demand, to the great dammage of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Channery.</hi> And this was remedied with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and witty Invention, to unite as many <hi>Beneſices</hi> as pleaſed the <hi>Pope,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the Life of him on whom they were conferred, by whoſe death the <hi>

               <p n="1">1. This was a Direction to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſerving them for their preſent State and Time.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Much leſs did he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Churches</hi> sapart from the <hi>Jews,</hi> to receive, and conſider, and redreſs the Complaint and Injuries of their Brethren; and if he did, yet is there not one Syllable in the Text to induce us to believe that ſuch <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was conſtituted only of <hi>Eccleſiasticks,</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> or of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or that it was to continue and remain in force for ever in the <hi>Church.</hi>

To <hi>the Baptiſm of</hi> John <hi>came the Publicans,</hi> Luke 3.12. <hi>and were received of him. Our Saviour was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a friend unto them,</hi> Mark 11.19. <hi>Matthew the Apoſtle was choſen ſitting at the Receipt of Custom,</hi> Mat. 9.9. <hi>Zackeus a chief Publican was the Child of Abraham,</hi> Luke 19.9. <hi>The Publican that prayed in the Temple was juſtiſied before the Phariſee,</hi> Luke 18.14. <hi>and told by Christ, that they ſhould go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven before the Scribes and Elders that deſpiſed them,</hi> Mat. 21.21.

               <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Ethnicks</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who, though they were Strangers to the <hi>Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> when as yet they knew no <hi>God,</hi> yet never were they perſons <hi>excommunicated;</hi> and ſince the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> they became partakers of this Promiſes, and true Members of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> ſo that this can be no Rule for <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> to ground <hi>Excommunication</hi> upon, nor yet to meaſure perſons <hi>excommunicated</hi> by <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> ſeeing that amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> Publicans believed, and entred the Kingdom of God; and after the Rejection of that Nation, the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> conſiſted chiefly, if not wholly of Gentiles and Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks converted.</p>
               <p>Others argue thus; 1. They were <hi>Jews</hi> to whom <hi>Christ</hi> ſpake. 2. Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them <hi>tell it to the Church,</hi> he ſends them to ſome Judge or Judicature, to which they could go, and were bound to obey. 3. It is certain the <hi>Moſaical Judicial Law</hi> was then in being, and to them obligatory, and ſtood ſo till Chriſts Death, he and his Apoſtles living under the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. 4. They ſay for certain the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> was not then Conſtituted; ſo that it is irrational, if not ridiculous, to ſay that he ſends them (when he bids them <hi>tell it to the Church</hi>) to any <hi>Epiſcopal, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Judges, when there were no ſuch things in the World. 5. It is then evident that he ſends them there to ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Judges, to whom they could go, and were bound to obey. And the <hi>Jews</hi> had then (as alſo before and after) three Courts of Judicature. 1. The Supreme, the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> which ſate only in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. The <hi>Conſeſſus-viginti-trium-viralis,</hi> which conſiſted of 23 perſons in greater
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50679:50"/>Towns and Cities. 3. <hi>Conſeſſus trium-viralis,</hi> wherein the Judges were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three, and ſuch a Judicature they had in all leſſer Towns, and every one of thoſe Courts was uſually called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> a <hi>Church;</hi> ſo that (to thoſe ſo opinionated) it ſeems certain that the Perſons and the Cauſe (an Action of Treſpaſs only conſidered) it was the <hi>Conſeſſus triumviralis</hi> he ſends them unto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Christian Church,</hi> ſay they, cannot for the Reaſons above-ſaid, be meant in thoſe Words, <hi>Tell it to the Church;</hi> though with the ſame Breath they cannot deny, but acknowledge, that wherever Chriſt taught and converted men, there was a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> yet ſay, that while he lived, it was under the <hi>Legal Oeconomy,</hi> and not that of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for that, when our Saviour ſpake that, the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (which only makes a Member of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi>) nor the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>All which are capable of a very ſhort Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> It is certain, and without diſpute evident by the very Texts themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.46. that Chriſt ſpake theſe words in a <hi>Houſe</hi> in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Diſciples, applying himſelf to them in particular; but what <hi>Jews</hi> were there, let the Texts be Judge. But be it that a mixt multitude of <hi>Jews, Gentiles</hi> and others (for they all ſlockt after him, and he ordinarily taught them even in the <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Synagogues,</hi> though forbidden by the <hi>Jewiſh Magiſtracy</hi>) to all which Chriſts Precept of <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> was very applicable, and by them very practicable, though more eſpecially and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly directed to his <hi>own Church;</hi> and be it, that the Sacraments were not then inſtituted, nor a Local or Formal Church conſtituted, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the Fleſh, governing it by his own <hi>ſic dico, ſic jubeo;</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peradventure, <hi>converted Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Converſion incorporated into <hi>Chriſts Body the Church, though not yet Baptized,</hi> which their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did afterwards declare and manifeſt to all the World their open admiſſion into <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> and their open Profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Chriſt in the days of his Fleſh, and his Diſciples were under the <hi>Legal Oeconomy,</hi> is very true as to their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Civil Concerns;</hi> but then it is as true that his <hi>Goſpel Precepts</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> were not ſubject to that <hi>Legal Oeconomy,</hi> but the contrary; if otherwiſe, the Goſpel had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been preached unto them by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, nor ever could have been preached unto the utmoſt ends of the Earth, as was foretold and promiſed. Though neither <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian</hi> nor <hi>bid pendent Churches</hi> were then eſtabliſhed, yet Chriſt had his <hi>Church</hi> then in being, though not ſo diſtinguiſhed; and to that Church he ſent his Diſciples and Auditors ſo to do, when he ſaid <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> as beſt beſeeming the Profeſſors of him and his Goſpel. As to the conſideration of Actions of Treſpaſs only, be it ſo, that the Matters of Treſpaſs only were in that Mandate of Chriſt to be conſidered, yet even in thoſe Chriſt would have all his Members ſo to govern and demean themſelves as he there preſcribes; but if ſtill the Offenders will be refractory, and not ſubmit to thoſe Rules, what then? Then let him be to thee as a <hi>Heathen,</hi> or a <hi>Publican; i.e.</hi> purſue him in the Civil Courts of Judicature (as if he were ſeparated from your Company, (which is all the Excommunication that I know of) and not a Brother in Chriſt) be it the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or the <hi>Conſeſſus viginti-trium-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> or the <hi>Conſeſſus trium-viralis,</hi> to which, all both <hi>Jews, Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were to yield Obedience.</p>

               <p>All which rightly conſidered, makes not the leaſt for <hi>Excommunication,</hi> but rather ſhews, that there was no neceſſity of introducing any other Government into the <hi>Church Chriſtian,</hi> the reſt all belonging to the Civil Governments of Princes and States.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant what work, what ſtrange work <hi>Romiſh Hectors</hi> make of theſe two Words, <hi>viz.

Unto me the moſt Natural and Genuine Sence of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 22. ſeems to import,<note place="margin">The proper ſence of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 22.</note> that <hi>Christ</hi> well knowing that his Apoſtles and Diſciples which were to ſurvive him, and whom he intended to Commiſſionate to Teach and Baptize all Nations, and to gather a People unto himſelf, by declaring the Mind and Will of his Father, by preaching his Goſpel, and that out of the very boſom and bowels of Kingdoms and Commonwealths which then were, and alſo likely ſo to continue for many Generations then to come, prophane and ſworn Adverſaries to his Goſpel, and unto the Preachers and Embracers thereof, and conſequently would be in as great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Troubles as Sheep among Wolves; and therefore his all-ſeeing Wiſdom thought fit to preſcribe them ſuch a Government and Diſcipline, which they might exerciſe among themſelves in much peace and quietneſs, ſuitable to the Goſpel of Peace, and without any noiſe or diſturbance to the Magiſtrates or Subjects of any Nation or Kingdom, or to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, how wicked or adverſe ſoever they ſhould be to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Kingdom, and therefore here he preſcribes them ſome Rules, more particularly relating unto private Offences, which muſt needs be, whilſt men are men. If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Party grieved muſt be <hi>Man,</hi> not <hi>God.</hi> If <hi>thy Brother treſpaſs against thee,</hi> (not againſt <hi>God</hi>) <hi>reprove him:</hi> The firſt Admonition muſt be ſecret and friendly, as between Brother and Brother, between thee and him alone. Again, if the wrong-doer repent himſelf, the Sufferer muſt forgive him, and not ſeven times only, but ſeventy times ſeven, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. and elſewhere. <hi>viz. Luke</hi> 17.3, 4. This together with the Lords Prayer, teacheth us to forgive the Sins that are committed againſt our ſelves; but we have here, no directions. nor power to remit other mens ſins and harms, much leſs to remit and pardon the Injuries offered unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he repent not, we muſt yet give him a ſecond Admonition with one or two witneſſes, before we tell it to the <hi>Church;</hi> and if he then repent we muſt then alſo forgive. Theſe be no Precepts for open and notorious ſins, diſhonouring <hi>God,</hi> and ſcandalizing his <hi>Church</hi> (for ſuch the Rule is given, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Thoſe that ſin rebuke openly, that the rest may fear;</hi>) but for private Treſpaſſes between man and man. This is no <hi>Judicial proceeding</hi> in <hi>Epiſcopal Audience,</hi> in the Conclave, or Conſiſtory, but a charitable war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſecret, by him alone that is grieved and oppreſſed with wrong or reproach. This is a general Duty binding every Chriſtian, and not a <hi>ſpecial Authority to Popes and Presbyters.</hi> There is no Command that the open and ſcandalous Sinners ſhould be reproved in ſecret, or twice admoniſhed before they be cenſured by the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>inceſtuous Corinth</hi> had neither private nor double warning before he was delivered to <hi>Sathan by the Church,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Advice.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Christ</hi> declined intermedling with the Judicial part of ending Controverſies and differences between man and man, yet he preſcribes them Rules to compoſe them themſelves. 1. By private admonition of the Party grieved. 2. By admonition of two or three of the Brethren of the <hi>Church.</hi> 3. If they prevail not, then to communicate the wrong done to the <hi>Church,</hi> i.e. to the whole Congregations of Believers whereof both Parties are members (and not to the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Priest,</hi> whereof not one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50679:52"/>plain Syllable in the Text) ſo that, not only by the mouth of two or three witneſſes only, but alſo by the teſtimony and admonition of many, even of the whole <hi>congregated Church,</hi> every word may be eſtabliſhed, that by ſuch publick reproof the wrong-doer might be brought to repentance and amendment. 4. If he neglect all private and publick admonition, then let him be to thee as a <hi>Heathen-man</hi> and a <hi>Publican, i.e.</hi> do not own him to be of your Congregation, but purſue, and proſecute, and implead him, as thou wouldſt do an <hi>Ethnick</hi> or <hi>Publican,</hi> or any one that is not of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> and Congregation, in any of the Courts of Judicature of that City and Kingdom wherein they live. <hi>Christ</hi> for the Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Goſpel, would have none of his to be wrong-doers, or be given to ſtrifes and debates, or to <hi>go to Law before the unbelievers,</hi> as it is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2, 8. <hi>If ye have Judgment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for things pertaining to this life,</hi> what then? (Tell the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals;</hi> nothing leſs, but) <hi>ſet them to judge who are least eſteemed in the Church</hi> (in which Rank I dare not place either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> leſt they bring their Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> for my ſo doing) and make them Judges of your Cauſes and Quarrels; where by the way it is obſervable, that the Word <hi>Church</hi> in this place alſo doth not ſignifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Presbyters</hi> only, but the whole congregated <hi>Church,</hi> the Sequel will clear it. <hi>Is it ſo that there is not a wiſe man among you, no not one, that ſhall be able to judge between his Brethren? but Brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> v. 5.6. Where the words (<hi>Brethren, a Wiſe man, not one, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi>) are general and indeſinite Terms, and not limited to <hi>Eccleſiaſtics.</hi> Then certainly <hi>Christ</hi> never meant that the Members of his <hi>Church</hi> ſhould for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Treſpaſſes complain to the <hi>Pope</hi> or his <hi>Pariſh-Priests,</hi> and that they ſhould have power ſufficient to hear and determine all ſuch Matters as were ſo offered unto them, and to excommunicate thoſe that would not ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Sentence and Determination, that would have been an Infringement and incroachment on the Magiſtrates Office; for the Matters of Complaint are of that Nature, that the Miniſters of Chriſt might not challenge to hear and determine, they were forbid it. <hi>Man, who made me a Judge or Divider over you?</hi> Luke 12.13, 14. And <hi>as his Father ſent him, ſo ſent he them,</hi> John 20.21. and conſequently did belong to the Civil Magiſtrate. Beſides, neither in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. nor yet in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. the Word <hi>Church,</hi> whether thereby ſhould be meant <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> can poſſibly ſigniſie the Prieſts of either, (or at leaſt not excluſive the <hi>Laity</hi>) whatever the ſcope and drift of theſe two places are, it cannot be to Authorize the <hi>Clergy</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with matters pertaining to the Magiſtrate, and to exclude thoſe from the Society and Communion of the Saints and Sacraments, that obey not their reſolution.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Excommunication,</hi> or <hi>Binding</hi> or <hi>looſing</hi> be to be proved out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. as the <hi>Papalins</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> would have it, yet it is ſuch as is common to the <hi>Laity</hi> in private offences, <hi>i.e.</hi> to every Individual of the <hi>Church.</hi> For what concerns <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Looſing,</hi> the Words are plain and demonſtrative, <hi>viz.

Theſe are <hi>general Precepts,</hi> and purport a <hi>general Duty,</hi> binding every Chriſtian, and not eſpecial or applicable only to <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Presbyters: Christ</hi> then in theſe places ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of private men and offences, which he only that is oppreſſed and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath moſt right to reprove and forgive; and therefore not only the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> making whom they pleaſe <hi>Banditi?</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but the reprehenſion and admonition of our meaneſt Brother offended and injured by us, muſt be regarded and reverenced, for ſo much as the Lord on high heareth the deſires, and granteth the Prayers of any two joyning together for his Glory, and others Good; and in their own debts and treſpaſſes private perſons have more right to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> their oppreſſors before <hi>God,</hi> than either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter.</hi> This power here attributed to all Chriſtians, is no new Doctrine, but hath been acknowledged for good by St. <hi>Auſtin, Theophylact,</hi> and others, and it doth not in the leaſt derogate from, or impeach the publick uſe of the Keys in the hands of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> for they had alſo their particular Commiſſion, <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſins ſoever ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are retained:</hi> yea ſpeaking particularly to one of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> all <hi>Priests</hi> received in <hi>Peter</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death, and after his Reſurrection, he gave all his Apoſtles the like power, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> obſerve, and that is a power which no Temporal or <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> can confer; it is derived unto them from a higher Power.</p>
               <p>§. I am not ignorant that theſe Doctrines are held as <hi>Heretical</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they that hold them are curſed with Bell, Book and Candle; which is obvious to every intelligent Reader that conſults the <hi>first, fifth,</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> Canons of the <hi>ſourteenth Seſſion</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Anathemaes</hi> following, who ſhall find it to be ſo; and I humbly conceive not without grand reaſon of State-Papal: for ſhould theſe Doctrines, and theſe that depend upon them, be received for Orthodox, <hi>Adieu</hi> to all the <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks</hi> of all the ſecreteſt Councils of all Kingdoms and States where <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrines prevail; and alſo <hi>Adieu</hi> to a world of <hi>Merry-pence</hi> that elſe would thereby come into their Sanctuary <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> their Coffers, for commuting and mitigating of Penance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For by their Inſtitution of their <hi>Sacrament of Penance,</hi> their <hi>Church</hi> underſtands it to be inſtituted by <hi>Christ, an entire, full and Sacramental Confeſſion of all ſins, to be made by all perſons of the years of diſcretion, lapſed after Baptiſm,</hi> and that <hi>Jure Divino it is abſolutely neceſſary ſo to do,</hi> and that becauſe <hi>Christ</hi> before his Aſcenſion into Heaven, leſt his <hi>Priests</hi> to be his <hi>Vicars tanquam Praeſides &amp; Judices,</hi> unto whom all mortal Sins ought to be brought and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereby by vertue and power of the <hi>Keys of remiſſion and retention of Sins,</hi> Mat. 16.19.

James</hi> writ not to them, but <hi>to the Twelve Tribes ſcattored abroad.</hi> This, Text is an Argument to perſwade us to confeſs our faults one to another and to pray one for another, that we may receive reciprocally the Councils, Benefits and Conſolatinos of each others Prayers; but this inſtitutes no <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Confeſſion</hi> to be performed to <hi>Romiſh Priests,</hi> nor any power of pardoning to the <hi>Pope</hi> or his <hi>Priests,</hi> nor any greater obligation on the <hi>Laity</hi> to confeſs to the <hi>Priest,</hi> than on the <hi>Priests</hi> to confeſs to the <hi>Laity.</hi> Mark the enforcement, The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man (Prieſt or not Prieſt) availeth much. Though theſe <hi>Canons</hi> make the <hi>Priests</hi> the only <hi>Miniſtrators</hi> of <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion,</hi> and that the Act in them is not <hi>Nudum Ministerium, a naked Miniſtery</hi> of pronouncing and declaring Sins to be forgiven to the confeſſed, but that it is in the <hi>Priest Act us Judicialis, a Judicial Act,</hi> by whom, <hi>velut à Judice, as by a Judge,</hi> Sentence is pronounced, <hi>Canon</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>They farther make the very <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> to alter the kind of them, and therefore they have made two kinds of Sins, <hi>viz. Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial, Canon</hi> 5. which is more than ever God himſelf made, though he made two kinds of Sinners, <hi>voz. Penitent</hi> and <hi>Impenitent.</hi> And in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion they have Anathematized all thoſe that are of contrary Opinions, though there be not one plain Text of Scripture to warrant their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now I would very fain know why the Inſtitution being made by the Word <hi>Remitto,</hi> the Form alſo was not <hi>Remitto, I remit</hi> thy Sins, rather than <hi>abſolvo te, I abſolve thee;</hi> and that if by theſe words a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Abſolution</hi> is inſtituted with this Form <hi>Abſolvo te,</hi> by which one is abſolved, why it doth not follow by an irreſiſtable neceſſity, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrament of Binding be not inſtituted, in which this Form ſhould likewiſe be <hi>Ligo te;</hi> becauſe it cannot by any right Reaſon be underſtood how the ſame Authority to <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>bind,</hi> founded upon the words of Chriſt, <hi>abſolutely alike,</hi> doth require in Abſolution the pronouncing of the words <hi>Abſolvo te,</hi> and that other of Binding, doth not require pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the words <hi>Ligo te;</hi> nor by what reaſon to execute that which Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Whoſe Sins ye retain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. And it is not neceſſary to ſay <hi>Ligo te,</hi> but to execute <hi>whatſoever ye looſe on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>whoſe Sins ye remit,</hi> it is neceſſary to ſay <hi>Abſolvo te.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Canon</hi> doth alſo declare that Chriſt by the ſame words did conſtitute the <hi>Priests ſui ipſius Vicarios tanquam Praeſides &amp; Judices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. <hi>Judges of Sin,</hi> and therefore that it is neceſſary to <hi>confeſs them all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and in particular</hi> (which is impoſſible for him that confeſſeth to know) together with the Circumſtances, which <hi>ſpeciem peccati mutant,</hi> alter the kind; ſeeing that it doth appear by the words of the Lord, that he hath not diſtinguiſhed <hi>Two ſorts of Sins,</hi> one to be <hi>remitted,</hi> the other to be <hi>retained,</hi> whereby it would be neceſſary to know of which ſort the Delinquent is guilty; but one only, which doth comprehend all; and therefore the word <hi>Peccata,</hi> Sins in general is only uſed; but he hath
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50679:54"/>diſtinguiſhed two ſorts of Sinners, ſaying, <hi>Quorum &amp; Quorum,</hi> one of the <hi>Penitent,</hi> unto whom Remiſſion is granted; another of the Obſtinate or <hi>Impenitent,</hi> to whom it is denied; therefore they are rather to know the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Delinquent,</hi> than the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Sins;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> which they ſay alter the kind, certainly every good Chriſtian may ſwear with a very good Conſcience, that the holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Diſciples, moſt skilful in things ſpiritual, <hi>not regarding humane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,</hi> did never know what were the Circumſtances which alter the kind, and yet there is made of it an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> neceſſary to Salvation. But as it is approved by the <hi>Papists,</hi> that <hi>Abſolvo</hi> was a <hi>Judicial Word,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a good Conſequence, that if the <hi>Priests</hi> do abſolve, they are Judges; ſo it appeareth to be an inconſiſtency to condemn thoſe who ſay it is <hi>a naked Ministery to pronounce</hi> and to <hi>Anathematize</hi> thoſe that ſo think, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> 6, 9. It being plain, that the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Judge</hi> is nothing but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him innocent who is ſo, and the <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> guilty, and that this the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of the <hi>Judge</hi> doth not bear, that the <hi>Priest</hi> can make a Juſt man of a Delinquent, as is aſcribed to him. The <hi>Prince</hi> indeed may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Traitors and other Offenders, and reſtore them to their good Names and Blood; to whom, he that maketh a wicked man juſt, is more like than to a Judge, who doth ever tranſgreſs his Office when he pronounceth any thing but that which he findeth to be true according to <hi>Allegata &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata.</hi> But that which is moſt wonderful, they prove the Doctrine of <hi>Specifical and ſingular Confeſſion of Sins</hi> with the <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> by affirming out of <hi>Can.</hi> 5. That the Judicature cannot be executed without knowledge of the Cauſe, nor Equity obſerved in impoſing puniſhment, if the faults be known only in general, and afterwards, that Chriſt hath commanded this Confeſſion, that they may impoſe the condign puniſhment: What is this but plainly to mock the world, and to think all men void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding but themſelves, and to perſwade themſelves that all their Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities muſt be believed upon truſt, how abſurd ſoever? For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and ſeeth not daily the Confeſſors enjoyn Penance not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing the Merits of the Faults, but without having the leaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them? It would ſeem by the words of the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> that the Confeſſors ſhould have a Ballance to make difference of every Grain, and yet oftentimes to recite <hi>five Pater nosters,</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Penance</hi> for many Murders, Adulteries and Thefts, and yet the moſt learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and generally all in giving Penance, do ſay to every man, that they do impoſe only part of the Penance, therefore it is not neceſſary to impoſe that exact Penance which the Faults do deſerve, nor to have a particular enumeration made of the Sins and Circumſtances. But what need one go ſo far, when the ſame <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>Ninth Chapter</hi> of the Doctrine, and the <hi>Thirteenth Anathematiſm,</hi> doth ordain, that ſatisfaction is made by <hi>voluntary Penance,</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50679:54"/>to decide juſtly, much leſs hearing, and reſolving preſently, as the Cuſtom is.

In this charitable Office,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14.</note> to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the offended, and pardon to the offender, the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was always exerciſed. And unto this Rule did St. <hi>Paul</hi> conform, when he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that Brothers having Civil Suits one againſt another, ſhould not go to the <hi>Tribunals</hi> of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> but that <hi>wiſe men</hi> (not <hi>Priests</hi>) ſhould be appointed to <hi>judge</hi> the <hi>Differences;</hi> and this was a kind of <hi>Civil Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as the other was the ſimilitude of a <hi>Criminal,</hi> but were both ſo different from the Judgment of the world, that as theſe are executed by the power of the Judge, who enforceth ſubmiſſion, ſo thoſe only by the will of the Guilty to receive them; who refuſing them, the <hi>Eccleſiastical Judge</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth without execution, and hath no power to enforce, but to foreſhew the Judgment of God, which will follow in this Life or the next.</p>
               <p>This kind of Proceedings, and this kind of Judicature was according unto Chriſt's Inſtitution, and would not enterfeer with any Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Chriſtian or not Chriſtian, and unto which the Apoſtles did conform, and which laſted ſome <hi>Centuries</hi> of years in the <hi>Church,</hi> and was eſteemed by the Saints of thoſe more pure times the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> not of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> becauſe they did thereby <hi>charitably,</hi> not <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially</hi> or magiſterially reconcile the perſons, compoſe the differences, and rebuke the Sins and Vices, of the Believing Brethren, and did thereby prevent the Scandal and Reproaches that otherwiſe they and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would have been expoſed and liable unto from Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>This kind of Judicature was ſo far from being eſſential or peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as that the <hi>least esteemed in the Church</hi> were as capable of it as the greateſt; indeed any that were <hi>wiſe and able to judge between the Brethren, rather than to ſuffer them to go to Law before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.4, 5, 6. The Apoſtles (who had greater Abilities, and underſtood their Commiſſion better than ever any <hi>Pope</hi> did) refuſed to take this Charge upon themſelves, as being not fit for <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to take any <hi>Civil Employment,</hi> that might any way impede the main End and Deſign, (which was to <hi>give themſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Ministry of the Word</hi>) and by reaſon whereof they could not ſerve God in that whereunto they were chiefly called, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distraction;</hi> and therefore for the ſame reaſon would not <hi>ſerve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> but would have ſuch Duties devolved upon others, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3, 4.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50679:55"/>Nay, <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſolemnly profeſſeth that <hi>Christ ſent him not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. So wholly did he devote his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the exact performance of his Commiſſion. Of the ſame Opinion was the Biſhop of <hi>Aiace</hi> in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> who in the Debate of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,</hi> which he held to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> complained that the cauſe of their <hi>Non-Reſidence</hi> was, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did buſie themſelves in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> and in the Affairs of the World, being <hi>Judges, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Secretaries, Councellors, Treaſurers,</hi> there being few Offices of State, into which <hi>Biſhops</hi> have not inſinuated themſelves, though forbid by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. who thought it neceſſary that a Souldier of the Church <hi>ſhould not entangle himſelf with the Affairs of this Life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Souldier;</hi> therefore he moved that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would conſtitute, that it ſhould not be lawful for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or others who have Cure of Souls, to exerciſe any Secular Office or Charge.</p>
               <p>In the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, there is a whole <hi>Title</hi> to this effect; <hi>Ne Clerici vel Monachi Secularibus negotiis ſe immiſceant.</hi> And St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath a long Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">In Decretal. in <hi>Mat.</hi> Hom. 26. Conſid. 1.24.</note> complaining of Clergy-men leaving the Care of Souls, become <hi>Proctors, Economists,</hi> &amp;c. practiſing things unbeſeeming the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Papalins</hi> cannot deny theſe to be great Truths, yet in this, as in divers other Caſes, they pleaſe themſelves with falſe Gloſſes upon plain Texts of Scripture, aſſerting moſt Magiſterially for their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Popes Authority to diſpenſe not only with Humane, but Divine Laws: that in Humane Laws his Authority is abſolute and unlimited, becauſe he is ſuperior to them all; and therefore when he doth diſpenſe, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe, the Diſpenſation notwithſtanding was to be held for good; and that in Divine Laws he had power to diſpenſe, but not without a Cauſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging St.</hi> Paul <hi>for their juſtifications,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. Who ſaith that the Miniſters of Chriſt are <hi>the Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God, and that to him the Apoſtle, the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel had been committed,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.17. And that howſoever the <hi>Popes Diſpenſation concerning the Divine Law, be not of force, yet every one ought to captivate his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and believe that he hath granted it for a lawful Cauſe, and that it is Temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to call it into queſtion,</hi> Hiſt. Conc. <hi>Trent,</hi> 675.</p>
               <p>Bonny Gloſſes I muſt confeſs, and well calculated for the <hi>Zenith</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> Altitudes and Authorities, but they are quite contrary to <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine,</hi> and the Concluſion drawn hath no warrant at all from the Text; for the Text doth not prove a power of <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> to be in the <hi>Biſhop of Rome, i.e.</hi> a Diſobligation from the Law and Commandments of God and the Goſpel, as the <hi>Popes</hi> would have us believe, but only a power to diſpenſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> to publiſh and declare the Divine Myſteries and Word of God, which is perpetual, and remaineth inviolable for ever; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.2, 8, 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. <hi>c.</hi> 4.3. What is this but to wreſt and pervert the very Words and Senſe of Scripture, and as much as in them lieth, to make a new Goſpel, as they made a new Creed at <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Human Laws happily a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> may lie; for that the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are ſubject to infirmities and fallibility, and unable to foreſee all Caſes, and future Accidents and Occurrences, which when they come to be diſcovered and known, may juſtly admit of ſome Exceptions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations. But where God is the Law-giver, from whoſe all-ſeeing Eye nothing is concealed, and by whom no Accident is not foreſeen, the Law
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50679:55"/>can have no Exception, no <hi>Diſpenſation;</hi> for that by ſuch <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> the ſtrength of all <hi>Gods Laws</hi> is taken away, made null, and in truth eſcheated into the Breaſt and Power of the <hi>Popes Holineſs.</hi> From ſuch corrupt Gloſſes it is that there are few or no <hi>Cardinals</hi> without <hi>many Biſhopricks,</hi> how incompatible ſoever they are together. Hence alſo the Uſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendaes</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> for Life; <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> (at firſt invented probably for good ends) by which againſt all Laws, many Beneſices were given to one perſon alone really, with appearance that he had but one only. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of God and Nature ought not to be eſteemed as a common written Law, which in ſome Caſes happily may be diſpenſed withal, and made more gentle, for that all his Laws are even Equity and Juſtice it ſelf. Beſides, the <hi>Pope</hi> who takes himſelf to be the great <hi>Diſpenſer Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> cannot in any caſe free him that is bound. <hi>Paul</hi> was obliged to <hi>preach the Goſpel, as being called thereunto,</hi> (and ſo was <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and all the Biſhops and Prieſts are no otherwiſe ſent and called, than to preach the Goſpel, and feed Chriſt's Flock, as all the Apoſtles were, which includes the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, if he be <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor) <hi>yea a neceſſity was laid upon him, yea wo unto him if he did not preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. And therefore he moſt earneſtly deſires the <hi>Epheſians, c.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20. <hi>that they would always pray with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watch thereunto with all perſeverance and ſupplication for him;</hi> for what I pray? that he might have a <hi>Diſpenſation not to preach,</hi> or not to attend his Flock, and be Non-reſident, or having put his hand to the Plough, that he might look back, or that he might have great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Civil Affairs, in Princes Courts, that would neceſſarily hinder his preaching? Nothing leſs: What then? <hi>Even that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance might be given unto him, that he might open his mouth boldly, to diſpence and make known the Mysteries of the Goſpel, for which he was an Ambaſſador,</hi> Eph. 6.18, 19, 20. The like unto the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> c. 4.2, 3. And did not the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſolemnly, and moſt ſeverely <hi>charge</hi> Timothy <hi>before God and the Lord Jeſus Christ, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom, to preach the Word, to be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. By which it demonſtratively appears, that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Grammar and Conſtruction, to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> and <hi>make known,</hi> are Terms Synonimous and Equivalent, maugre the falſe Gloſſes of the <hi>Papalins.</hi> And when think you would <hi>Paul, unto whom by Revelation was made known the Myſtery of Christ, whereof he was made a Miniſter, that he ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable Riches of Christ, and to make all men ſee what is the Fellowſhip of the Myſtery, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 3.2, 3, 8, 9. or any other of the Apoſtles have beſought <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Rome,</hi> for a Diſpenſation not to Preach? They were better taught than ſo, than to take other Civil Employments, which muſt neceſſarily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from preaching, and declaring the Myſtery of the Goſpel; for in true underſtanding, to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> and not to preach, is to be no <hi>Priest,</hi> having as much as in them lies, un-prieſted themſelves after the Character imprinted; for Chriſt never gave any Authority to his Miniſters, but what was <hi>meerly and purely Spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſo it was that the Judgment of the <hi>whole Church</hi> or Congregation, (as is neceſſary and natural to all Societies Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, for the ſake of Order) was fit to be conducted and managed by ſome one, who ſhould preſide, and guide the Actions and Deliberations, propoſe the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and collect the Reſults of the Aſſembly which Care being always
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50679:56"/>due to the moſt worthy, and beſt qualified perſon for ſuch an Action, was moſtly committed to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> not of right, but of choice.</p>
               <p>§. This kind of Judicial Proceeding was obſerved and kept on foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Year 250,<note place="margin">Ep. 5. f. 12, 13, 14.</note> as is plainly to be ſeen by the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who in the matter concerning thoſe, <q>who did eat of Meats offered to Idols, and ſubſcribed to the Religion of the Gentiles, writeth to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he doth not think to do any thing without <hi rend="blackletterType">their Counſel,</hi> and the <hi rend="blackletterType">Conſent</hi> of the <hi rend="blackletterType">People;</hi> and writeth to the <hi>People,</hi> that at his return, he will examine the Cauſes and Merits thereof, in their <hi rend="blackletterType">Preſence,</hi> and under their <hi rend="blackletterType">Iudgment.</hi> And he wrote to thoſe <hi>Priests,</hi> who of their own heads reconciled ſome, that they ſhould give an Account unto the <hi rend="blackletterType">People.</hi>
                  </q> Soon after this time of the Day theſe kinds of Proceedings begun to loſe of their <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and to degenerate into <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> For indeed as before, ſo more eſpecially, and more confidently, ſoon after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Days and <hi>Donations,</hi> the ſucceeding <hi>Biſhops,</hi> not without ſome Artifices, and ſome Uſurpations, quickly began to <hi>ſet up for themſelves;</hi> and indeed in ſhort time mounted ſo high, that they became ſuſpected of <hi>Princes,</hi> and terrible to the <hi>People;</hi> their <hi>Tribunals</hi> became a common Pleading-place, having obtained Execution by the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petr. AErodius.</note> and to obtain the Name of <hi>Epiſcopal Jurisdiction,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal Audience,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in one Day, nor in one Age; the Piety and Charity of that more pure Age made them and their Judgments to be had in great veneration, which inſenſibly was the Cauſe that the <hi>Church</hi> in the trueſt ſence, not regarding the Charge given and laid upon them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, did ſupinely leave the Care to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who readily and with great care embraced it, and ſoon erected their <hi>Tribunals.</hi> This kind of <hi>Judgment,</hi> though it were not like to the firſt, in regard of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> to determine all by the Opinion of the <hi rend="blackletterType">whole Church,</hi> yet it had ſome ſemblance with it; and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> finding ſome Eaſe and Conveniency, to have Cauſes determined by the Authority of Religion, added this to his other Powers granted to them, <hi>viz. That no Appeal ſhould lie from the Sentence of the Biſhop;</hi> and <hi>Valence</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in the Year 365. But thoſe <hi>Judicial Proceedings</hi> and Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did <hi>not pleaſe;</hi> the beſt and <hi>most pious Biſhops</hi> being of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, who deemed ſuch Employments and Powers not fit for a <hi>Preacher of the Goſpel,</hi> and therefore would not take ſuch himſelf. But <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> 70 years after the Law of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> finding the <hi>Biſhops</hi> to degenerate, and to abuſe their Power, revoked that Law in part, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ſhould judge Cauſes of <hi>Religion,</hi> not <hi>Civil,</hi> except by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that they ſhould not be thought to be a <hi>Court;</hi> which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved in <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>great power</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> there had, <hi>Valentinian</hi> being there in the Year 452. did renew it; but the <hi>ſucceeding Emperors</hi> reſtored ſome part of it, and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> eſtabliſhed unto them a <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Audience,</hi> &amp;c. By which means and gradations the <hi>Popes</hi> had got the <hi>Knack of encroaching,</hi> and were thereby the better enabled to crave and get more, and that not without making the world believe that thoſe, and more were their due, and that not <hi>Jure Eccleſiaſtico</hi> only, but <hi>Divino</hi> alſo; a Band ſo ſure and ſtrong, that it would hardly be looſed, though Poſterity ſhould find Inconveniences, and would redreſs them. 200 years were not fully elapſed ere they claimed abſolutely <hi>all Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50679:56"/>Criminal</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> over the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and in ſome things over the <hi>Laity</hi> alſo; pretending the Cauſe was <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Beſides, they contrived ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of <hi>Judicature,</hi> which they termed <hi>Mixt;</hi> whereby they hooked in <hi>all Judicature</hi> to themſelves; ſo that after the Year 1050. having with much Art and Induſtry Monopolized all the Cauſes of the <hi>Clergy</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and very many of the <hi>Laity,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and almoſt all the reſt, under the Title of a <hi>Mixt Judicature,</hi> and placing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the <hi>Secular Magistrates,</hi> upon pretence of Juſtice denied: they were at length ſo bold as to ſay, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had the power to <hi>judge,</hi> not <hi>by the grant or favour of Princes, or by the will or conceſſion of the People, or the whole Church, or by Cuſtom or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage; but that it was eſſential to the Epiſcopal Dignity, and given to it by Christ;</hi> whereby they put ſuch a Hook in the Noſes, and ſuch a Yoke on the Necks of <hi>Laicks</hi> and <hi>Civil Magiſtrates,</hi> that the <hi>Papalins</hi> themſelves have never ſince been able to ſhake it off unto this very day. And though the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Emperors</hi> remain in the <hi>Codes</hi> of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> and in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulars</hi> of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire,</hi> and though all Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, both Eccleſiaſtical and Prophane, do ſhew how, when, and by whom theſe Powers have been granted, adding the Reaſons and Cauſes, yet <hi>ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, ſo notorious a Truth</hi> hath not had ſuch power, but that a bare <hi>Ipſe dixit of the Popes,</hi> without any proof at all, hath been able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, which the <hi>Canonists</hi> have ſo far maintained, as to declare thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> who do not ſuffer themſelves that have been thus long blindfold, to remain hoodwinkt ſtill.</p>
               <p>Though the Light of this Truth was not ſo extinguiſhed, but that both Learned and Pious men in thoſe very firſt times did oppoſe their Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That no Civil Magiſtrate could meddle in any of thoſe Cauſes which the <hi>Clergy</hi> had appropriated, becauſe they are Spiritual; and that <hi>Laicks</hi> are uncapable of things Spiritual; yet the oppoſition of the better, who had the <hi>Truth</hi> on their ſide, could not overcome the greater part, and ſo upon the Spiritual Power given by Chriſt to the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> and upon the <hi>Institution</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to compoſe Contentions among Chriſtians, without going to the Tribunal of Infidels, in tract of time, and by many gradations,</q> a <hi>Temporal Tribunal</hi> hath been built by their own Induſtry, Arts, and Ambition, and for their own Uſe, Ends, and Intereſts, more remarkable than ever was in the world, or can be parallell'd; for thereby they have erected <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> raiſed to themſelves an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire independent</hi> of the Commonwealth, and (which is more intolerable) eſtabliſhed on ſuch grounds (ſuch as <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is it) which have ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with ſuch admirable ſucceſs, that it hath given the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> as much at once, as former Biſhops were getting in 1300 years before; and all this by making not the Power to <hi>bind and looſe the foundation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but the power of ſeeding,</hi> and ſo affirming, that <hi>all Jurisdiction was given the Pope by Christ in the perſon of</hi> Peter, when he ſaid to him <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi>

As alſo, when ſome for abuſing the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> became <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>ſick,</hi> and <hi>fell aſleep,</hi> or <hi>became dead:</hi> Theſe and the like might have been Arguments for the like Powers, had they not died with the Apoſtles; but with <hi>Excommunication</hi> they have no Analogy, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance: they were <hi>Arrows</hi> indeed in the <hi>Quivers</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens (as one of them expreſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.) of an Apoſtle, wrought with Signs, and Wonders, and mighty Deeds, but no <hi>Arguments for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;</hi> whereby it is evident that in their Days, when as yet there were no <hi>Christian Magiſtrates</hi> to puniſh the Sins and Offences of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the power of God, ſometimes by himſelf, ſometimes by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, did afflict and puniſh the diſobedient more or leſs grievouſly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their Sins were more or leſs heinous, that thereby they might <hi>learn not to blaſpheme, nor yet to detain the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and that the reſt might fear to provoke his Wrath and Indignation by like Sins and Uncleanneſs. For without all controverſie, the <hi>Delivery unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> the <hi>ſmiting ſome with Death,</hi> and others with <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> were Corporal puniſhments, and of a far different Nature from that of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> even according to their own ſhewing, there being not any other puniſhment belonging to the eſſence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50679:57"/>the ſole debarring from the participation of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>§. However, let us a little conſider the Delivery of the <hi>Inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto Sathan,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. of which no ſmall uſe is made to juſtifie <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> Take the Story as it lies plainly in the Text, without any Vizards or Equivocations. St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtanding <hi>that there was ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication at</hi> Corinth, <hi>as was not ſo much as named among the Gentiles,</hi> viz. <hi>that one ſhould have his Fathers Wife,</hi> wrote unto them his firſt Epiſtle, and ſent it by <hi>Stephanus and others,</hi> ſignifying unto them, that though he were <hi>abſent in Body, but preſent in Spirit, had already judged as preſent, him that had ſo done,</hi> and therefore <hi>adviſed them in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Christ, that being gathered together,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit with the vertue of the Lord Jeſus Christ, to deliver ſuch a one unto Sathan.</hi> Now it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this <hi>Epistle,</hi> he was abſent, at <hi>Philippi,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and directed it not to any one ſingle perſon, <hi>Pope</hi> or other, but <hi>unto the <hi rend="blackletterType">Church</hi> of God which was at</hi> Corinth, <hi>and to them that were ſanctified in Christ Jeſus, called to be Saints, with <hi rend="blackletterType">all</hi> that in every place call upon the Name of Jeſus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.</hi> He did not (according to <hi>Romiſh Custom</hi>) write by his <hi>Breves,</hi> I <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> ſuch a one (and in one Scrap of Paper ſend (as much as in him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> nay whole Kingdoms and States to the Devil) but he wrote to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Church</hi> (a <hi rend="blackletterType">Collective Body</hi>) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>gathered together</hi> with his Spirit, they ſhould deliver that <hi>Inceſtuous perſon to Sathan.</hi> And again, when he wrote his <hi>Second Epistle,</hi> he dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it alſo unto the <hi rend="blackletterType">Church of God</hi> which was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> with <hi rend="blackletterType">all the Saints</hi> which are in all <hi>Achaia,</hi> declaring it ſufficient to ſuch a Man is this Puniſhment, which was <hi rend="blackletterType">inflicted of many;</hi> admoniſhing <hi rend="blackletterType">them</hi> to forgive, and comfort him, leſt perhaps he ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow; whereby it is plain, and not to be gainſaid, that the Delivering of him <hi>unto Sathan</hi> (be the Puniſhment, be the Cenſure what it will) it was inflicted <hi rend="blackletterType">by many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. Now if <hi>Paul</hi> an <hi>Apostle,</hi> would not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> or <hi>deliver unto Sathan</hi> at his own will and pleaſure, but would conſult the <hi>Church,</hi> that the Matter being tranſacted by <hi>common Authority</hi> and Approbation, the Cenſure, the Puniſhment might be performed by <hi>Common Conſent:</hi> It being moſt juſt and equal, and of <hi>Moral Right,</hi> that they who to morrow muſt deliver ſuch a one to <hi>Sathan,</hi> whom to day they account as a Brother dear in Chriſt, ſhould be fully ſatisfied why and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now how came <hi>Signore Papa</hi> alone to be entituled to exerciſe <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers greater</hi> than the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> would uſe? What hath he to do with it more than the reſt of his Brethren? If ſo interrogated, I can make no other Anſwer but <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Moreover, hath the practice of <hi>Christ's Vicars</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> been correſpondent to that of <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apostle?</hi> of ſuch eſteem and prevalency is publick conſent with <hi>God himſelf,</hi> even in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> that though in his ſecret Decree <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were to be ſet apart for the Work of the Miniſtry; yet by God's own appointment were they ſeparated, after Faſting and Prayer, to the ſame, by the <hi rend="blackletterType">Church</hi> which was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13.2. Thereby teaching us not to deſpiſe the Office of the <hi rend="blackletterType">Church, <hi>i.e.</hi>
                  </hi> of the <hi rend="blackletterType">Multitude</hi> of Brethren where it may be had.</p>
               <p>By theſe very ſmall Hints it is eaſily diſcernable what a Noſe of Wax the <hi>Papalins</hi> make both of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Excommunication</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50679:58"/>their great and terrible Thunderbolt, even againſt <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> not conſidering the little efficacy it hath. What was the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and her <hi>Duke,</hi> or <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and her <hi>Dominions</hi> the worſe for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Excommunications</hi> and Interdicts? or what the worſe the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> for being excommunicated every <hi>Maunday Thurſday?</hi> And indeed what the worſe his Holineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> for being ſolemnly excommunicated every year by the <hi>Muſcovite? Fops!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. Some indeed of later days have intimated a great and juſt diſlike of thoſe who have hitherto endeavoured to hang <hi>Excommunication</hi> on ſome doubtful Places of Scripture, but yet endeavour to ſettle it on another Baſis, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Nature and Conſtitution of the <hi>Church Christian,</hi> as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt; <q>whereby they ſay it is manifeſt that if <hi>Excommunication</hi> cannot be eſtabliſhed upon ſome better and other Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom than what hath hitherto been laid by their Predeceſſors on ſome <hi>doubtful places of Scripture,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily decay and fall to the ground; moreover they moſt ingenuouſly confeſs themſelves unſatisfied as to any convincing Argument whereby it can be proved that any were denied Admiſſion unto the Lords Supper, who were admitted to all other parts of Church-Society, and owned as Members in them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. Though I have ſaid enough already <hi>ſparſim</hi> (that if rightly applied) doth demoliſh this Fabrick of Fundamental Right, yet I will add a little, and but a little more, <hi>viz.</hi> that if by the Word <hi>Church</hi> in theſe Poſitions, be meant only the <hi>Clergy</hi> (met or not met in <hi>Councils, Synods, Conſistories, Convocations</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> as the Repreſentatives of the <hi>Church,</hi> Aſſembled by their <hi>own power,</hi> as by a Fundamental Right grounded on Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) then to ſay no more, is hereby juſtified <hi>Robert Bruce, David Blake, and thoſe ſeventeen Scottiſh Ministers</hi> before-mentioned, and their Tenets, denying the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> to have any Authority in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſtical. For certainly if God hath given them power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Aſſemble, and Conſult, and make Laws, and hath not withal given them Force and Power to put them in execution, they have only a mock and ridiculous Authority, which God never inſtituted nor ordained. And if it be not ſo meant, then they either ſay nothing to the purpoſe, or equivocate.</p>
               <p>But if herein by the Word<note n="*" place="margin">By the word <hi>Church,</hi> may be meant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers holding ſaving Truth in general, of what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or quality ſoever; or elſe more ſtriftly, the collective Body of the Clergy; for if we ſpeak right of the Church Univerſal, or this or that Particular Church, as of <hi>Spain, France, England,</hi> &amp;c. this Term may be taken in either of thoſe two Sences.</note> 
                  <hi>Church,</hi> be meant the Civil Power, and <hi>Laity,</hi> together with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> then we are Friends, and that Fundamental Right ariſing from the Conſtitution of the <hi>Church,</hi> derived from Chriſt himſelf, of Right belongs to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Commonwealth,</hi> if <hi rend="blackletterType">Chriſtian,</hi> and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very congregated Number of Believers gathered in any Gentile State or People, and united into one Society, and not only to the <hi>Clergy</hi> thereof, and the <hi>Laity</hi> are as capable, and have as <hi>much Right</hi> to be of ſuch <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi> as the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or that the <hi>Church</hi> be not <hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>perpetuo</hi> a peculiar Society, <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (as certainly it is not) or that the <hi>Officers</hi> thereof (as limited by theſe Poſitions, unto <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> injuriouſly enough, if they pretend beyond Teachings, Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sacraments, Impoſition of hands for Ordination, and the publick uſe of the Keys) are not only inflicters or executioners of <hi>Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> (as certainly they are not) then the very Foundation of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick for the Support and Juſtification of <hi>Excommunication</hi> muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:50679:58"/>
               <p>It is true that every <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>Society,</hi> or <hi>Body Politick,</hi> though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Body Politick</hi> is not a <hi>Church:</hi> every Member of the <hi>Militant Church</hi> is ordinarily a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Christian Commonwealth</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> wherein he lives, and <hi>è contra.</hi> That which differenceth the <hi>Church</hi> properly ſo called, from a Society or Body meerly Civil, is the diverſity of Laws, and Ordinances, and the different manner of Union betwixt the Members of it. A <hi>Church,</hi> A <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or Body Civil are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily two <hi>Bodies contra-diſtinct</hi> or Oppoſite (as the Romaniſts often dream or preſuppoſe in their Arguments brought for the Prerogatives of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> alledging that thoſe have firſt their being, and then they frame their Government, and therefore are free, and that all <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in them, which they do communicate to Magiſtrates, <hi>without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving themſelves of it:</hi> But the <hi>Church</hi> did not make it ſelf, and its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but Chriſt did firſt Inſtitute Laws by which it ſhould be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and then did Chriſt aſſemble it) but rather, <hi>one Body</hi> endowed with ſeveral or diſtinct Powers or Perfections; when a Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth becomes Chriſtian, and Conſequently, a <hi>Church,</hi> it looſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what it had, but rather acquires a New Perfection and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, by the Accrument of Divine Powers added to the Civil: It may be true, that when the <hi>Church</hi> was firſt Founded by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that it was altogether diſtinct from the Commonwealth, for indeed it could not be then otherwiſe, for that all Kingdoms and Commonwealths were then open, and profeſſed Enemies to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and therefore the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given unto the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was accordingly ſuch as might be exerciſed by the Members thereof in any Nation, and among any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, be their Government what it would, or their Enmity to the Goſpel never ſo great, without claſhing or interfeering with it, or with them, and without the leaſt diſturbance of the quiet State of the Kingdom or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereunto they were ſent for their Converſion. But when that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie that <hi>Kings ſhould be the Nurſing Fathers, and Queens the Nurſing Mothers of the Church</hi> was to be fulfilled, and whole Kingdoms embraced the Goſpel and became Chriſtians, then the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one, and were no longer <hi>contra diſtinct:</hi> Certainly the Juſtifying of <hi>Excommunications</hi> or <hi>Church Cenſures</hi> in this manner, on ſuch grounds and Poſitions is (to ſpeak modeſtly) ſcarce ſafe or defenſible. For that they ſeem too much to Countenance and to approach too near unto the Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Papiſts, which are 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that the Spiritual Power, is above all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and Civil Power, which Aſſertion were it rightly limited, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is in it ſelf Orthodox as here is declared, but the more Orthodox it is in it ſelf, the more Pernitious and deadly it makes the ſecond Poſition, unto which they ſeek to Wed it, <hi>viz.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that this Supream and Spiritual Power is totally Stated in the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as in a <hi>Body diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>Body Politick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the moſt of them hold the plenitude of this Power to be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> from whom all Spiritual Power of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is derived unto the reſt of the Clergy, after the ſame manner as <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> in cauſes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral is derived unto the <hi>Inferior Magistrates,</hi> from the <hi>Civil Monarch</hi> in each <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And that the <hi>Regiment</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>Regimen Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicum,</hi> a <hi>Viſible Monarchy,</hi> of which the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>viſible Monarch,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without all doubt, it is not only leſs Obnoxious to Cavils and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, but alſo, more truly Orthodoxal, and more Juſtiſiable to aver and maintain, that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth Christian,</hi> tho happily like

               <p>The Faithful Flock of Chriſt ought to reſemble Sheep indeed in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and innocency, yet ought they not to be ſo ſheepiſh or ſottiſh as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Authority which Chriſt their great Shepherd hath beſtowed on them, either of chooſing them a Good, or of judging a Wicked Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. St. <hi>Austin</hi> proves unanſwerably, that Doctrines are to be grounded on the Literal Senſe of the Scripture, and not on any Myſtical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>In this equivocating Art of Sophiſtry <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſhewed both in this Subject as in others, his great dexterity, firſt to ſettle with the Reader the <hi>Relation</hi> which the Holy <hi>Church</hi> hath towards the Divine Majeſty, and then to conclude on the Relation towards the <hi>Pope;</hi> ſuch falſe Sophiſtry, ſuch diſingenuity becomes not ſo great a Prince, ſo great a Scholar as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the <hi>Pariſians</hi> (no Proteſtants) conclude that God hath called the <hi>Church</hi> to the Faith and his Worſhip, and that he hath placed <hi>Christ</hi> over it for an <hi>Head</hi> for ever, who firſt himſelf did govern it on Earth in the days of his Fleſh, but being aſcended into Heaven, doth rule it with inward influence and aſſiſtance inviſible unto the end of the World.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the <hi>Church</hi> is not a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as <hi>Venice,</hi> or as <hi>Geneva,</hi> which give as much Authority as themſelves pleaſe to their <hi>Dukes,</hi> and <hi>Princes;</hi> nor a Kingdom, which may change the manner of governing it, neither inviſibly nor viſibly, becauſe that <hi>Christ</hi> hath preſcribed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: much leſs is it ſuch a <hi>Kingdom</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> which hath a <hi>Blood-Royal,</hi> where the <hi>Kings</hi> ſucceed <hi>by Birth,</hi> neither as ſome other <hi>by Testament;</hi> but as touching the Inward Government, and meerly Spiritual, it is not like unto any, becauſe it hath a perpetual Immortal and Eternal King, <hi>who only knows the Heart and tries the Reins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>viſible Government</hi> it hath a <hi>Ministry</hi> whoſe Authority was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>independing of the Church,</hi> but as concerning the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of this Authority unto this or that Perſon it is <hi>elective</hi> or <hi>depending</hi> of it. Wherefore when he alledgeth, <hi>I am constituted a King by him. Our Lord God ſhall give him a Kingdom,</hi> Luke 1.32. and 12.32. <hi>You choſe not me, but I have choſen you,</hi> John 15.16. <hi>Thou haſt made us to our God a Kingdom.</hi> All theſe places, and ſuch like others, are meant of the <hi>Inviſible, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Interior Kingdom,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no regiment nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence at all, but Chriſt is all in all governing by his Spirit, and according to the Council of his own Will.</p>

               <p>§. If Kings be not this way puniſhable, then they are no other way, which is miſchievous in the <hi>Church.</hi> Sol. The <hi>Jewiſh Kings</hi> were as great and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinners, as <hi>Kings-Christian</hi> now are; yet God aſſigned no Rulers Spiritual for their Caſtigation, and we muſt ſuppoſe that if it had been ſo extreamly, and publickly miſchievous, God would not have ſuffered it: Beſides, if Scandal ſhall not remain unpuniſhable in the <hi>Prince,</hi> yet it ſhall in the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> which is a Miſchief of the ſame nature with the other: For if <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhall abide the Cenſure of this or that froward <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> what Judgment ſhall the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> abide? If this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Supremacy reſt in any one, that one muſt be unpuniſhable; for two
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50679:60"/>Supreams are things incompatible: And if this Supremacy reſt in more than one, is is very hardly conſiſtent with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> for the one or other muſt be tranſcendent.</p>
               <p>§. Without all contradiction it is a manifeſt violence to uſe the Power of <hi>excommunication,</hi> be it what it will (if any ſuch thing there be at all) granted by Chriſt, contrary to his own Inſtitution, and towards him, that hath Power, and unjuſtly uſeth the ſame, the remedy is to have recourſe to a Superior if he may, but if there be no Superior to whom to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>God</hi> hath allowed no other remedy to a <hi>Prince</hi> thus offended, but to make reſiſtance with his own force, oppoſing himſelf and force to force, becauſe it comes from <hi>God:</hi> And the Civil Being of every <hi>Common-wealth</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is to the end of his Glory: And therefore a Prince cannot permit without a ſin and offence, that his own Liberty ſhould be infringed, which is the Civil Being of every Principality, and there is no doubt, but that negligence in defending it, is a dangerous offence to God, and moſt hainous, if he voluntarily ſuffer it to be uſurped and incroached upon.</p>
               <p>§. To obey therefore the Commandements of <hi>God, Kings,</hi> when acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and aſſaulted by Excommunication <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> may and ought to oppoſe themſelves againſt the Authors of them, that will take away the Power which God hath given them to make <hi>Laws both Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,</hi> and with Juſtice to defend themſelves and their injured Subjects, in their Lives, Honours, Goods, and Religion. And as the Innocent by an error <hi>in facto,</hi> unjuſtly excommunicated, to avoid ſcandal, is bound pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure. So when the Error is <hi>in Jure,</hi> and the manifeſt injuſtice thereof is apparent, to avoid ſcandal likewiſe, the <hi>Prince</hi> is bound to reſiſt and oppoſe himſelf againſt the Injury. Becauſe there is no doubt but that ſuch unjuſt Cenſures are againſt <hi>Magistracy</hi> it ſelf; and therefore when it ſhall be known to other Kingdoms, that ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> or State for fear of unjuſt Cenſures, and thoſe invalid, hath yielded unto violence, (whereof there are Examples not a few) and omitted to exerciſe, and execute his Natural Power, they would be exceedingly ſcandalized thereat; as alſo the Subjects that ſhould diſcover ſuch a vain fear, they would become very perverſe: And therefore for this cauſe alſo, it is both equal and neceſſary for the <hi>Prince,</hi> to make due reſiſtance; for ſuch, no doubt, or more weighty Reaſons, have <hi>our Kings and Queens</hi> defended themſelves, and their Subjects, againſt all ſuch Thunderbolts; and ſo did the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> who, without, any colour of reaſon, excommunicated them, being not a few Millions of Men: The like have the <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> done, and they had Authority ſo to do, by their great Charter from Heaven. The <hi>Church,</hi> both <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>Clergy,</hi> ought to pacifie their Minds and Conſciences, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Service of God under the protection of their Princes, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing, that the Holy Ghoſt was promiſed and given to all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, both <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> amongſt whom Chriſt himſelf is preſent when they are congregated in his Name, and that none can juſtly be excluded out of the Holy <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> except by their own ſins they be firſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the favour of <hi>God:</hi> and that the obedience which <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to perform to our Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, is not a fooliſh or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Subjection, nor the Power of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> an Arbitrary Judgment, but both the one and the other muſt be ruled by the Law of

               <p>§. Of old the <hi>Holy Biſhops</hi> did preach and teach Princes, that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Callings, the one of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the other of <hi>Princes,</hi> were bound in both of them, to ſerve <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Christians</hi> in obſerving the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50679:61"/>as every other private Perſon; but as <hi>Princes</hi> to ſerve God by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining juſt and good Laws, and directing their Subjects, to Piety, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and Juſtice, by having <hi>his Eyes on the Faithful of the Land, that they that excel in Vertue and Piety may dwell with him, by not countenancing wicked Perſons by erecting publick Places of Worſhip,</hi> and as much as in them lyeth, by chalking out a <hi>High-way of Holineſs throughout their Dominions, by their Good and Pious Example, that way-faring Men, though Fools, might not erre therein,</hi> by puniſhing all ſuch as tranſgreſs Gods Commandments, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> wherein thoſe that ſin againſt the firſt Table, which more immediately concern the Divine Honour, are worſe than thoſe that ſin againſt the Second, which concern Juſtice amongſt Men: Wherefore Kings are more bound to puniſh Blaſphemies, Hereſies, and Perjuries, than Murders and Thefts. For this cauſe were divers Laws made againſt ſuch Crimes as are Regiſtred in the <hi>Justinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſian Codes,</hi> impoſing on the guilty Pecuniary Mulcts, Baniſhment, Privation of Part, or of all their Goods, according to the Circumſtances of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the execution of which Laws are committed to their Secular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: And accordingly this our Kingdom, from its Original of being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, hath been accuſtomed to ſentence and puniſh in caſe of grievous offence, any Perſon Eccleſiaſtical, of what Degree or Order ſoever; by which means it hath hitherto preſerved the Ancient and Independent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of its true Dominion and Empire.</p>
               <p>§. Every Criminal Judgment hath three parts: 1. For Example,<note place="margin">Criminal Judgment hath three parts.</note> The Cogniſance of the Cauſe. 2. The Cogniſance of the Fact. 3. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. 1. For Example, In the Judgment of Hereſie, or the Cogniſance of the Reaſon, is, whether ſuch an Opinion be Heretical or no? 2. The Cogniſance of the Fact, is, whether the Perſon ſo accuſed or denounced hath defended or held the ſame? 3. The Sentence conſiſteth either of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving or Condemning: The firſt Cogniſance, what Opinion was Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, was moſtly Eccleſiaſtical, but not abſolutely excluſive of Secular Learned Men, appointed by the <hi>Emperors.</hi> And when there grew any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of ſome Opinion, the <hi>Emperor</hi> did require the Judgment of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and if need were, did call <hi>Councils.</hi> For the Cogniſance of the Fact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accuſed Perſon were Innocent or Guilty, that he might have the puniſhment ordained by the Laws of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the Sentence of Condemnation, or Abſolution, did all belong to the Secular Power.</p>
               <p>Thus were matters ordered for Cauſes of Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> until about 800 Years after Chriſt, when the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> being divided from the <hi>Western,</hi> this Form reſted in the <hi>Eastern</hi> till the end of it. In the <hi>Weſtern</hi> the Princes needed not make any Laws, nor take much care about this Buſineſs, ſeeing for the ſpace of 300 Years, from 800 to 1100, there were very few Hereticks found in thoſe Parts, and when any Caſe did happen which chanced but very ſeldom, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> did judge of it in the ſame manner as he proceeded againſt <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Perſons,</hi> as againſt Infringers of Holy-days, Breakers of Faſts, and ſuch like judging and puniſhing them themſelves, in thoſe Places, where they had Juriſdiction granted them by the <hi>Princes,</hi> and where they had not the like Power, they did implore the Secular Aid to puniſh them. After the Year 1100. by reaſon of the continual differences, which for about <hi>fifty Years</hi> before had been between the <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> and laſted afterwards for a whole Age, until about 1200 Years, with frequent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50679:62"/>Jars and Wars, and the <hi>wicked life</hi> of the then <hi>Clergy,</hi> there did ariſe an infinite number of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are pleaſed to call them) whoſe moſt common Hereſies were againſt the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> and where the Multitude of them exceeded, there was a <hi>forced Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time of the day <hi>Pope Innocent the fourth</hi> ſubtilly deſigned, by introducing the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi>

               <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> ſinding great oppoſition from all Places, he offered one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which in ſhew made the Civil Magiſtrate the <hi>Inquiſitors Companion,</hi> but in Subſtance and Effect <hi>his Lacquey.</hi> This Oppoſition grew ſo ſtrong, and was ſo univerſal, that the <hi>Pope</hi> could not introduce his <hi>Tribunals Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory,</hi> except it were in the Provinces of <hi>Lombardy, Romania,</hi> and <hi>Marca Treviſana,</hi> nor in them neither, for all his <hi>Bulls</hi> and ſevere <hi>Edicts</hi> as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, no nor yet as he did without great reluctancy and oppoſition, from the Civil Magiſtrates, though in thoſe three Provinces his Authority was very great, they having no Prince, and each City governing it ſelf; and where the <hi>Pope</hi> alſo had a part, becauſe he had aſſiſted them in their late Wars: And although the ſaid <hi>Frederick, Anno</hi> 1244. ſet forth four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, receiving the <hi>Fathers Inquiſitors</hi> into his protection, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Penalty of Fire <hi>(the firſt Law that impoſed death)</hi> upon obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Hereticks; for which kindneſs, and aſſiſtance of his, he was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well requited by the ſame <hi>Pope,</hi> who firſt <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and then <hi>depoſed him;</hi> and, as <hi>Hier-Marius</hi> reports, corrupted one <hi>to poiſon him,</hi> which not taking effect, corrupted another to <hi>ſtrangle him;</hi> ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the fourth</hi> his Succeſſor, <hi>Anno</hi> 1259. and <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth 1265. were conſtrained to <hi>moderate the Edicts</hi> of <hi>Innocent the fourth:</hi> And four other ſucceeding Popes employed themſelves in overcoming the difficulties, which thwarted them in ſetling the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> After ſome moderation, it being ſetled in thoſe three Provinces, it afterwards crept into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Arragon,</hi> and into ſome Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> out of which it was ſoon exiled, and in <hi>Arragon</hi> they were reduced to a very ſmall number. Into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> it was not brought, there being little correſpondence between the <hi>Popes,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> thereof. In the Year 1484. the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> admitted it into his Dominions; yet ſo cautionate and jealous was he, as he reſerved himſelf to be <hi>Lord paramount</hi> thereof, of chooſing the <hi>Inquiſitor General,</hi> whom the <hi>Pope</hi> confirms: And for the reſt, the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> was not admitted to intermeddle any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that though the King ſeemed willing to gratifie the <hi>See Apostolick,</hi> yet did he reſerve his Supremacy of Power, over all Cauſes and Perſons Eccleſiaſtical, to himſelf; and ſo doth the <hi>State of Venice,</hi> by their <hi>Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>Inſpectors</hi> of the <hi>Tribunals Inquiſitory.</hi> In which Republick, the Inquiſition doth not depend on the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> but properly belongs to the Republick Independent, ſet up and conſtituted by the ſame, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by contract and agreement with <hi>Pope Nicholas the fourth, prout</hi> in his <hi>Bull</hi> of 28. <hi>Aug.</hi> 1289. wherein is inſerted the very determination of the greater Council made the <hi>fourth</hi> of the ſame Month.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50679:62"/>without being obliged to receive Orders from the <hi>Pope:</hi> And indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the admittance of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> there was in effect the ſame Office, though meerly Secular, to which <hi>Noble-men</hi> were raiſed, to enquire after <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and this the Republick made good afterwards againſt the See-Apoſtolick, in the Years 1289. 1301. 1605. 1606. and 1607. upon Diſputes, maintaining their Civil Authority <hi>in Eccleſiasticis</hi> to be their undoubted Right, and cannot be taken away by any <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> made in any manner, by any <hi>Pope</hi> to whom ſoever. <hi>Hist.

By all which it appears, that neither Monarchs, nor Free States, would be juggled out of their juſt Right of Commanding over Perſons and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſtical, and that thoſe Condeſcentions of the Civil Magiſtrates were only to gratifie ſome <hi>Popes</hi> out of ſpecial favour to them, and not for any juſt Right the <hi>Popes</hi> had unto them: For let <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> pretend what they pleaſe to the contrary, they do as much as in them lies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to erect <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> by giving Temporal Monarchy only an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect broken Right in ſome things, but controlable and defeaſible by the <hi>Spiritual Monarchy</hi> in other things.

But let us not doubt to ſubmit all things under one Supream on Earth, ſubmitting and recommending him by our Prayers unto his Supream in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for it is no ſmall thing in ſuch a Caſe to be left to the ſearching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: nor need we doubt or hold our ſelves utterly remedileſs, whilſt we can truly ſay, <hi>Omne ſub Regno graviore Regnum est.</hi> And let us not miſtake our Supream on Earth; for if God had intended to have left us a Spiritual Sword, or miraculous Judicatory, never before known or uſeful to the World, and that to be of perpetual neceſſity, <hi>ſans doubt</hi> he would have left us ſome clear command in Scripture, and not have involved and mantled his meaning in Metaphors, ſo intricate and ambiguous. But to let paſs this Theam of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> ſo unpleaſant to <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Ears, let us examine the Magiſtrates Power as it relates to Religion in commanding <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and concerning Toleration, Compulſion, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

All juſt Dominion and Empire is founded on true Religion and Piety, <hi>i.e,</hi> all Governours and Governments were ordained for the good of the Governed, and they are obliged by the Law of God to govern according to Rules of Religion and Piety, no <hi>Nation under Heaven having Statutes and Judgments ſo juſt and righteous as are preſcribed by God himſelf,</hi> and who act not according to them, an Iliad of <hi>Curſes will</hi> attend them, <hi>and their Plagues ſhall be wonderful, Deut.</hi> 28.58.

Now this Standard or Teſt, I call a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> without which, or ſomething equivalent, how is it poſſible for <hi>Kings</hi> to give a good account to <hi>God</hi> of their Care, and well-governing of the <hi>Church,</hi> within their reſpective Dominions; which <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> in general ought to contain ſo many <hi>Fundamentals of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> to the Belief of which if Chriſtians joyn anſwerable Practiſe, it may certainly bring them to Heaven.</p>
               <p>What the Particulars of this <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhould be, I will not here meddle withal, only thus, If it contain any thing contrary to the Word of God, it ought not to be, and much leſs to be enjoyned, and if it do, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt anſwer for it at the day of his Account, and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> thereunto not be blamed. Therefore, as he tenders the good of his own Soul, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves him to take care that all therein be warrantable by the Word of God, or at leaſt no way contrary unto it, and to leave nothing, or as little as is poſſible, upon a Moote Point. Concerning our own eſtabliſhed Liturgy, I ſhall only ſay this in general for Juſtification thereof, That whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults it, ſhall find no Point of Belief wanting in it abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that the Method of it is incomparably good, ſcarce capable of Melioration, being but the Hiſtory of <hi>Christ,</hi> beginning with his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> and ſo proceeding to his <hi>Nativity, Circumciſion, Epiphany, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcention,</hi> &amp;c. all very requiſite at leaſt, if not abſolutely

But of them all that have come unto my view, none, <hi>prima facie,</hi> carries more ſhew of Reaſon and Learning, than that which bears the Title of <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and their Impoſitions, publiſhed</hi> 1662. by a nameleſs Author. To anſwer which would require a large Volume; which not being my Work or Deſign here, I ſhall only, <hi>tanquam Canis ad Nilum,</hi> touch and away, give you a very ſhort Sum and Account of his large Diſcourſe, (containing above 170 Pages in <hi>Quarto</hi> in a ſmall Print) and ſay ſomething to the moſt material Arguments only of it; for there be many of his <hi>Averments</hi> and <hi>Postulata,</hi> which if we ſhould both give and grant, yet would be rather Arguments for than againſt Liturgies; as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never inſtituted nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Liturgies,</hi> that the <hi>Apostles</hi> never uſed them; nor yet the Fathers in the Pureſt Times. For though <hi>Christ</hi> never Inſtituted <hi>Liturgies,</hi> it is enough that he commanded, <hi>Rem Liturgiarum,</hi> the Matter, Worſhip, and Doctrines contained in our <hi>Liturgies;</hi> for of ſuch, and ſuch only, I deſire to be underſtood. If ſuch Reaſoning may be allowed for currant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it will certainly prove as ſtrong againſt Sermons and Adminiſtrations, that he or any other preacheth, and uſeth, as againſt <hi>Liturgies;</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50679:64"/>Chriſt never appointed the Form, though happily he hath the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the one and of the other, <hi>jam ſumus, ergo, pares,</hi> they are both on the ſame bottom. Beſides, is it reaſonable to think it fit that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom (even whilſt on Earth) <hi>dwelled all the fulneſs of the God-head bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,</hi> Col. 2.9. that had the Power of all Matter, Form, and Language, and whatever he ſpake or thought was <hi>infallible,</hi> ſhould yet tie himſelf to any ſtinted Forms of Words? The like ſay I for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in whom the Spirit alſo <hi>dwelt bodily as in Christ</hi> himſelf, even after the ſame <hi>manner,</hi> though not in the ſame <hi>meaſure,</hi> witneſs thoſe Emanations from their Words, from their Touch, from their Shadows, curing Diſeaſes by Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, Aprons and Shadows; and witneſs their <hi>Infallible</hi> Spirit, that what ever they dictated as Truth, was Truth, and is come down as Scripture to us: witneſs alſo the Cloven Tongues ſitting upon each of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and were endowed to ſpeak with Tongues. If the Apoſtles, I ſay, after all theſe Gifts and Graces ſo miraculouſly beſtowed on them, ſhould have limited the Spirit by uſing ſtinted Forms, happily they would not have been found ſo faithful in the Houſe of God, as was <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it then rational from ſuch Premiſſes to deduce this Concluſion, that becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (Gifted and Spirited in that abundant meaſure as they were) uſed no <hi>Liturgies</hi> nor <hi>stinted Forms,</hi> therefore we (that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible as they were, nor yet have the Spirit in the ſame meaſure as they had) ſhould uſe none? May not we rather, and with much more Evidence of Reaſon from the Nature of the thing varied, conclude the contrary to be abſolutely warranted; and for that very reaſon affirm <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi> and <hi>stinted Forms</hi> to be much more juſtifiable now, and rather to be uſed by us in theſe days, than by them in thoſe days? Certainly if they cannot lay moſt undoubted claim unto the ſame in-being Principles, and unto the ſame meaſure which was in them, this their <hi>Goliah</hi>-Argument hath its Head cut off with his own Sword. O! but in the Purer Times, next and neareſt to the days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> (who neither were <hi>Infallible,</hi> nor yet had the Spirit in the <hi>ſame meaſure</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> had) never uſed them: whether they did or did not uſe them, we neither cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, nor yet why they did or did not; and if we did, yet that could be no infallible demonſtration for us to do juſt as they did, without conſideration had of the diſferent poſture of Affairs between theſe and thoſe times: But be it ſo that they did not uſe them, what then? may not a ſucceeding Generation ſind out a neceſſary remedy, or convenient preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, to defend the pure Worſhip of God from Taint and Infection of Idolatry or Superſtition that a former Age two or three have not uſed. Such kind of Negative Allegations (Arguments they cannot be) may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to deliberate, and conſider, whether ſit to be appointed, or uſed or not; but can never rationally conclude, that therefore we can uſe nothing that thoſe Purer Times did not: The Condition and Poſture of Chriſtian Affairs are now altered. In the Primitive Times, next unto the days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> every Paſtor had care only of his own <hi>gathered Church,</hi> and every <hi>Biſhop</hi> with his Preſbiters of this or that City; and ſo in that reſpect (there being then no Civil Protectors, but all profeſſed Enemies of the Goſpel) no need then of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> though happily as lawful then, though not ſo neceſſary, as now, when whole Kingdoms and Common-wealths are become Chriſtian, and conſequently the care of their Spiritual State is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much more extenſive, ſtretching over great Kingdoms, is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50679:65"/>by <hi>Divine Right</hi> on the Civil Chriſtian Magiſtrate, who may, no doubt, impoſe a <hi>wholeſom Form of ſound Words by way of Lyturgy;</hi> for that without it, or ſomething equivalent to it, it is not poſſible for a Prince to have that due inſpection and overſight over his vaſtly-extended Flock, as a Shepherd may have of his Fold in one Pariſh or one City.</p>
               <p>§. But to ſum up his Diſcourſe in as narow a compaſs as I can, <hi>f.</hi> 22. <q>It treats about Chriſts Inſtitutions of Goſpel-Worſhip in his publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: The chief Acts whereof he refers to three Heads; 1. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word. 2. Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. 3. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Diſcipline, (of which he ſays little or nothing) all to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with Prayer and Thankſgiving. For the Adminiſtration of theſe, ſo far as they are purely of his Inſtitution, Chriſt gave Rules to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and appointed Perſons, 1. Paſtors and Teachers, for the regular Adminiſtration of them, which was to be performed and executed two ways, <hi>fo.</hi> 12.1. Either by ſuch Spiritual Abilities for the diſcharge and performance of this whole Work, as will anſwer the Mind of Chriſt therein, and ſo ſerve for the End propoſed: 2. Or by the Preſcription of a Form of Words, whoſe reading and pronuntiation in theſe Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould outwardly ſerve as to all the Ends of Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving required in them which they do contain. Againſt the ſecond way only he diſputes and argues ſtifly, averring, 1. That Chriſt not in any thing, or by any Act of his, did intimate the neceſſity or lawful uſe of any ſuch Liturgies as theſe which we are inquiring after, or preſcribed or limited Forms of Prayer or Praiſes to be uſed or read in the publick Adminiſtration of Evangelical Inſtitutions; but made proviſion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring all ſuch Preſcriptions uſeleſs, and becauſe they cannot be made uſe of, but by rejection of the Proviſion by himſelf, made unlawful. <hi>Fo.</hi> 29.2. No Liturgies uſed or preſcribed, or their uſefulneſs intimated by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor by the Churches of their Plantation. <hi>Fo.</hi> 20, 21, 38. It's but reaſonable to allow unto the Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that <hi>liberty</hi> in the Worſhip of God, which was confeſſedly left unto them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; <hi>fo.</hi> 24. and therefore unreaſonable to impoſe Forms on others whom they undertake to inform, 32. and who deſire to ſtand faſt in the <hi>Liberty with which Christ hath made them free;</hi> averring, That they muſt have a great conſidence in their own wiſdom and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, who will undertake to appoint and impoſe on others the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of things in the Worſhip of God, which neither the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> nor his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did appoint or impoſe; 22. and withal deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, That <hi>Liturgies</hi> ſhould be made the Hinge, whereon the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Miniſtry muſt turn. <hi>Fo.</hi> 31, 40. All ſuch Impoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of any Plea, or Pretence from Scripture, or Antiquity, <hi>f.</hi> 31. in his <hi>7th Ch.</hi> he declares, That he doth not in eſpecial intend the <hi>Liturgy</hi> now in uſe in <hi>England,</hi> any farther than to make it an Inſtance of ſuch impoſed <hi>Liturgies,</hi> whereof we treat; and therefore will not at all enquire what footing it hath in the Law, how, nor when eſtabliſhed, nor what particular failings are pleaded to be in it, nor what conformity it bears with the <hi>Roman Offices,</hi> &amp;c. nor doth he oppoſe the <hi>directive part</hi> of this <hi>Liturgy</hi> as to the reading of the Scripture, the Adminiſtration of the Ordinances by Chriſt appointed, nor the Compoſition of Forms of Prayer ſuited to the Nature of Inſtitutions to which they relate, <hi>ſo they be not impoſed on the Administrators of them to be read</hi> preciſely, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50679:65"/>But the thing alone which he would (be thought to) oppoſe, is, The compoſing of Forms of Prayer in the Worſhip of God in all Goſpel-Adminiſtrations to be uſed by the Miniſters of the Churches, in all publick Aſſemblies, by a preciſe reading of the Words preſcribed unto them, with Commands for the reading of other things, which they are not to omit upon the Penalty contained in the Sanction of the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the ſeveral parts of it, <hi>fo.</hi> 42. It is only about its Impoſition, and the neceſſity of its obſervance by vertue of that Impoſition that he diſcourſeth, <hi>f.</hi> 44.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. If the Author of this Diſcourſe had only purſued what he here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in theſe laſt words, and bent his Force only againſt the compoſing and impoſing of Forms of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c. i.e.</hi> Liturgies in general, he had dealt much more candidly, and ſaved himſelf and me ſome labour: But becauſe he ſeems to look one way, whilſt he rows another, pretends to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue only againſt Liturgies in general, how conſonant ſoever they be to Goſpel-Truths and Doctrines, (for againſt ſuch he muſt diſpute, or he hath no Adverſary that I know of, I am ſure I am no defender of any other) and their Impoſition, whilſt he ſhoots many envenomed Arrows againſt our eſtabliſhed Liturgy, (wherein his own conſent is involved, becauſe eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament and Convocation, and perhaps ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto by himſelf) and then concludes, <q>That on theſe and no better terms is that preſcribed Liturgy we treat of introduced and impoſed; [which Terms are, 1. That it is not appointed of God: 2. Not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Purer Times: 3. An Humane Invention: 4. Hinders Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: 5. An Abridgement of Chriſtian Liberty: 6. That it is made neceſſary by the Commands of Men;] and then admires with what peace and ſatisfaction to their own Souls Men can pretend to Act as by Commiſſion from Chriſt, as the chief Adminiſtrators of his Goſpel, and Worſhip, on the Farth, and make it their whole buſineſs almoſt to teach Men to do and obſerve what he never commanded, and rigorouſly to enquire after into the obſervation of their own commands, whilſt thoſe of the Lord Jeſus are openly neglected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I'le make no exaſperating Comment on theſe and other the like ſevere Reflections on our <hi>Anti-Liturgiſts,</hi> becauſe he pretends to uſe it only by way of Inſtance; neither will I, as I ſaid at firſt, go about to defend eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing relating to this, or that Liturgy, my deſign being only to defend the Compoſition, Uſe, and Impoſition of <hi>a wholeſom Form of ſound words,</hi> formed into that which we now call a Liturgy. It's enough for me if ſuch a Liturgy may be compoſed, againſt which there can be no juſt exception, and that there may be ſuch, I have never read, or heard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>§. The Ends of Liturgies our Author reduces ſingly into one, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Chriſt may be publickly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and ſolemnized in the Church with Decency and Order, unto the Edification of Aſſemblies wherein they are uſed:</q> But becauſe he confeſſeth that there is no other aſſigned that he knows of, I ſhall take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Aſſign one or two more, though this alone be ſufficient: 1. That ſo many Fundamental Truths (the neceſſary and common Food of all the Sons and Daughters of the Church) ſhould be daily and purely read and taught (as well as the Ordinances and Inſtitutions adminiſtred)
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50679:66"/>without corrupt Gloſſes or Comments, as may be ſufſicient to make the <hi>Comers thereunto wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> And that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſuch Truths needs no proof, it's Matter of Fact, and proves it ſelf. And if it doth not appear to be ſo unto the Author, let him diſcover its deſiciency, the radical neceſſary Truth that is not there taught, or not rightly taught therein, and I ſhall acknowledge it; and yet if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, it can only be a juſt exception againſt this Liturgy, but not againſt Liturgies in general that may be otherwiſe compoſed. 2.

                  </q> He farther adds, <hi>f.</hi> 34. <q>That many parts of the World, eſpecially the laſt in thoſe days, ſwarmed with <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who many of them, by unſuſpected wiles, and diſſimulations, and ſubſcriptions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</q> (and why may not theſe be practiſed again? and why may not Princes now uſe Liturgies, a Remedy found out, it ſeems by Prelates, and derived to our days, atteſted by many Ages to have been effectual againſt ſuch and the like evil Machinations of Sathan and his Diſciples, as well as Prelates did of old) <q>endeavoured to creep into the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church; partly out of blind zeal to diffuſe the poiſon of their abominations, partly out of carnal policy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which increaſed the neceſſity of compoſing ſuch Forms of publick Worſhip, as being ſilled with the Expreſſions pointing againſt Errors of thoſe times, might be a means to keep Seducers from impoſing themſelves on Eccleſiaſtical Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. Thus there is no Ancient Liturgy, but it is full of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that had been conſented upon in the Councils that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened for the condemnation of thoſe Errors which were in thoſe days moſt rife and pernitious.</q> Though theſe very Reaſons (abſtract from thoſe relating to the Power of Princes herein) prevail very much with me, and I am confident will with moſt rational and moſt unbiaſſed Perſons for the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Liturgies;</hi> yet our Author ſlights them, becauſe it doth <q>not appear unto him, <hi>that theſe Reaſons could poſſibly be taken from the Word, the Practiſe of the Apostles, or the Churches by them planted, or thoſe that followed them for ſome Generations, nor from any Council held
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50679:67"/>before their days, and ſo is not much concerned to know what they were.</hi>
                  </q> If our <hi>Author</hi> as an unbiaſſed and diſintereſſed unconcerned Perſon had conſulted Scripture as much about the Power of <hi>Kings</hi> in things pertaining to God, as he hath done about the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of his <hi>own Order,</hi> he could never have ſaid, that <hi>theſe Reaſons could not be poſſibly taken from Scripture,</hi> for <hi>Kings</hi> have their Power from Scripture as well as <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Though I have herein ſaid ſomething of the <hi>Kings Power,</hi> and more I ſuſpect than all of his Profeſſion, will cheerfully ſubſcribe unto, yet I will ſay ſomewhat more here. In the <hi>Christian Church</hi> the Right and Office of the higheſt Power is not only converſant about the whole <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> but about the <hi>ſingle Parts</hi> alſo, as Reaſons and Examples do evince. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot be otherwiſe; for he that hath Right upon the Whole, hath Right upon the Parts. An Example is, <hi>Ezekias,</hi> who, that he might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Adorers Superſtition, took away the <hi>Brazen Serpent, though ſet up by Moſes;</hi> and by the ſame Right, againſt the Decrees of the ſecond <hi>Nicene Synod, Charles the Great</hi> forbade the Adoration of Images. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is moſt plain, that the Supream Powers uſed their Authority in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things which the Divine Law hath left undefined: <hi>The King of</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevey <hi>proclaimed a Fast;</hi> David <hi>commands the Ark to be tranſported;</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>orders all things for the Ornament of the Temple, and after him</hi> Joſiah: <hi>who alſo takes care, that the Treaſure deſtined for Sacred <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes be not alienated. The Conſtitutions in</hi> Theodoſius <hi>and</hi> Juſtinians <hi>Codes, and the Novels, and the</hi> French <hi>Capitulars,</hi> juſtifie the ſame; but becauſe not in Scripture, I only mention them here. It ſeems very reaſonable, that if <hi>Princes</hi> have power to pull down a <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> though ſet up for the healing of the People by a <hi>Prophet,</hi> when once the People commit Idolatry by offering Incenſe to it, that they have alſo juſt Power to erect, or command an <hi>unqueſtionable Liturgy,</hi> that may really and effectually conduce to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or ſuppreſſing of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And therefore if the very words of ſuch <hi>Liturgy</hi> were not commanded preciſely to be read, but were only in the Nature of a <hi>Directory,</hi> (which happily may not be diſpleaſing to our Author) what could hinder but that ſome <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> might again intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce at the time of <hi>Baptizing of Infants</hi> the uſe of <hi>Spittle,</hi> the kiſſing of them, the blowing in the face of them, to blow away the Devil forſooth, to give them the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and many more ſuch Fopperies now generally difuſed amongſt Proteſtants, and others may baptize <hi>in Nomine Patris Filij &amp; Spiritus Sancti,</hi> as we do; others <hi>in Nomine Patris Majoris &amp; Filij Minoris,</hi> as the <hi>Arrians</hi> did; others, <hi>in Nomine Patris per Filium in Spiritu Sancto;</hi> others not in the Name of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> but in the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. and who ſhall hinder them? Other <hi>Sacrilegious Priests</hi> might alſo rob Gods dear Children of their Bleſſed Viands of half their juſt due in the Euchariſt, and give them Bread only, keeping the Wine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and teach them, that the Bread in their Hands is a proper, real, and propitiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt for the Living and for the Dead; and that which they eat under the ſhew of Bread, to be the very Fleſh of Chriſt; whereas in truth they eat only the Subſtance of Bread, and indeed may make them believe that the very Moon is made of Green Cheeſe, infect their Flocks at their pleaſure with <hi>Arrianiſme, Socinianiſme,</hi> the Doctrines of <hi>Adamites, Ranters, Quakers,</hi> and indeed what not? And if they did ſo, why were the Prince to be blamed if he did not prevent it if he had no Command or Power ſo to do? If he have Power, why ſo angry, that he makes uſe of it? If you know a better way, teach it, if not, ſubmit
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50679:67"/>to this, and acquieſee. This our Author ſeems to contradict by oppoſing <q>
                     <hi>experience</hi> to the contrary; and therefore, <hi>f.</hi> 63. <hi>he deſires that none would be</hi> offended, if as his own apprehenſion he affirms that the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Liturgies</hi> was on the account inſiſted on, the principal means of encreaſing and carrying on that ſad defection and apoſtacy, in the guilt whereof moſt <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>World had enwrapped themſelves.</hi>
                  </q> A bold Charge I confeſs, but not againſt us, and much they have to anſwer for, that impoſe and uſe ſuch <hi>Liturgies;</hi> and therefore I ſhall not be offended at this his Affirmation, but ſhall grant him his deſire, and conclude upon the truth of it, that if Idolatrous, Superſtitious, erroneous, and <hi>Heretical Liturgies, Maſs-Books,</hi> (call them what you will, for ſuch he muſt mean) have been ſo powerful and effectual to keep out Truth, and prevent the true Worſhip of God through moſt Churches in the World, what ſhould hinder but that Liturgies teaching nothing but what the Word of God teacheth, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing any thing in the Worſhip of God but what is according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (I muſt mind him that I plead for no other) ſhould be as powerful and as effectual for the keeping out of Hereſie, Idolatry, Superſtition, and what ever is contrary unto ſound Faith and Doctrine? And that they have been ſo, is as certainly verified, and as plainly to be demonſtrated in all Places where ſuch <hi>Liturgies</hi> (nay, though happily not altogether ſuch, though I wiſh they were all reduced to ſuch) have been uſed, as that which he affirms of erronious <hi>Liturgies.</hi>

Therefore nothing of Humane Invention, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo conſonant and advantagious unto the Truth, or the true Worſhip of God, is to be neceſſarily and indiſpenſibly uſed in the publick Worſhip of God. If ſo, then by the ſame Rule and Reaſon we may conclude, that no Man muſt teach in private, or preach in publick, for that ſuch Sermons, ſuch Catechiſings, are as truly the Inventions of the Brains of every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſon, as Liturgies are of the whole Church, or its Repreſentative; for be it that the Forms of <hi>Liturgies</hi> were never inſtituted nor commanded by Chriſt, no more were the Forms of any Sermon or Prayers preached or prayed by particular Men ſince the days of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles: It is enough that the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> both of the one and of the other be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Holy Writ: And we may reſt aſſured, that as God will bleſs the Gifts and Labours of private Men in publick Prayers and Sermons, ſo will he alſo bleſs the publick delivery of his Word and Mind by ſuch ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prayers, and ſuch ſelected portions of Scripture, as many learned, pious, and gifted Paſtors, Teachers and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Name and Fear of God (which is not without the Promiſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. of a Bleſſing) with Prayers and Supplications, inventing, diviſing, and ordaining for the Glory of God, and real good of the Souls of Men, have ſolemnly appointed to be gathered into an excellent Form and Method, called a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> to be ſolemnly read for Gods Glory, and the Peoples Good; when as Reading is as truly the Ordinance of God, as

But the Proviſion that Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies make, is, by a preciſe reading and pronouncing of the Words ſet down therein, without Alteration, Diminution, or Addition, and that <hi>toties quoties,</hi> (let ſo much go for currant;) and therefore excluſive the former, unleſs it can be made appear, that an Ability to read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed words of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> be the Gifts promiſed by Chriſt for the diſcharge of the Work of that Miniſtry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. <hi>This I conceive is no good Sequel, and must be inquired into; that thoſe that compoſed our Liturgy,</hi> or thoſe that may compoſe a new one, (either were or may be Perſons qualified and gifted for the Work of the Miniſtry, and for edifying of the Body of Chriſt, and conſequently without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) and that the <hi>Subject and Matter</hi> of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> is, or the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Contents of another <hi>Liturgy</hi> may be, (either is or may be will make good my Aſſertion for <hi>Liturgies</hi> in general) both for the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>Agenda,</hi> for Prayers, Thankſgiving, Inſtructions, and Exhortations
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50679:69"/>according to the Doctrine of the Goſpel I think no ſober Man will deny. Now if the Perſons and Matter be granted to be ſuch, then I conceive that it can be as little gain-ſaid but that the compoſing of ſuch Forms by ſuch Perſons is as truly a Gift, and an Exerciſe of ſome parts of the Gifts of the Work of the Miniſtry, as their compoſing of Prayers and Sermons, and afterwards praying, and preaching them without Book is by the ſeveral Miniſters of the Goſpel. This or that Form of words, and without Book, or within Book, cannot alter the Caſe.</p>
               <p>For that which giveth <hi>the very Being</hi> to Sermons, conceived Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the <hi>Wit and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding of Man,</hi> and conſequently they are many times corrupt; and it is the like Wit and Underſtanding of Man that gives Being to <hi>Liturgies, jam ſumus ergo pares,</hi> in this, though hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily they may have their reciprocal Excellencies and Preheminencies one over the other in this or that particular conſideration. I hope, and am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded, that this Author when he penned this Concluſion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <hi>(viz. And therefore excluſive the former, unleſs that it can be made appear, that an Ability to read the preſcribed words of the Liturgy be the Gifts promiſed by Christ for the diſcharge of the Work of the Ministers)</hi> did not intend to put tricks upon, or abuſe his Readers, by equivocally wording of it. For a Child, or Heathen, or Infidel, or any other not called to the Miniſtry that hath newly learned his Horn-Book, may have an Ability to read the preſcribed Words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in ſuch it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that an Ability to read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be the Gifts promiſed. And therefore he is not to be underſtood <hi>barely of an Ability</hi> to read, which any Infidel or Child may do, but <hi>of reading the publick Service of God</hi> by thoſe whom God hath appointed and gifted to adminiſter in his Temple and Church; and by the Gifts, that he doth not intend all the Gifts promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor yet that reading is the Gift <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> above all other Gifts, which are many; and therefore cannot reaſonably be intended that any one, or if he mean all, or more than <hi>one Gift,</hi> ſhould be <hi>inſtar omnium</hi> either inſtead or above all the other. It's enough for me if I can make it out <hi>that publick readings of the publick Service of God</hi> by the Paſtors of the Church be one of his many Gifts, or that it be an <hi>Ordinance</hi> appointed by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that it is <hi>quodam ſenſu</hi> preaching, or <hi>tant a monte:</hi> I ſhall not in the leaſt trouble my ſelf to prove reading to be a Gift, preſuming, that it will not be denied either by our Author or any other. But I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it appear that ſuch reading (ſuch reading as we both do or ſhould mean) is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> appointed by God, and practiſed by his People. And if it appears that both Precept and Practice doth abet and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the <hi>Liturgists,</hi> then I hope our Author will not be ſo peremptory in caſting Aſperſions on <hi>Liturgies.</hi>

               <p>§. Firſt conſult the Old Teſtament, and you ſhall find, that <hi>Moſes</hi> (gifted no doubt) <hi>himſelf took the Book of the Covenant and read in the audience of all the People,</hi> (and therefore publick Service) <hi>and they ſaid, all that the Lord hath ſaid will we do, and be obedient,</hi> Exod. 34.7. Likewiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the <hi>King, Deut.</hi> 17. was, That <hi>when he ſate upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhall read therein all the days of his life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. The like command was to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law written, That <hi>when all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Men, Women, Children, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, come to appear before the Lord thy God in the Place where he ſhall chooſe,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50679:69"/>thou ſhalt read this Law before all</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their hearing,</hi> (of Sermons in thoſe days there is no mention) <hi>to the end</hi> (and Liturgies are to the ſame end) <hi>that they may hear, and learn, and fear before the Lord your God,</hi> Deut. 31.9, 10, 11, 12. Moreover of <hi>Reading,</hi> and of the ſucceſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof, the Scripture farther witneſſeth, That when the <hi>Book of the Law</hi> had been ſome time miſſing, and was afterwards found, the good <hi>King Joſiah, which heard it but only read by</hi> Shaphan, <hi>tore his Cloaths, and confeſsed, that great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, and thereupon went up into the Houſe of the Lord, and all the Men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and he read in their Ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Chr. 34.18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby it is abundantly manifeſt, that here was not only a Command performed, (according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law</hi>) but repentance wrought by only reading of the Word: the like effect I mentioned before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. Again, the Solemn and Religious manner of reading, and hearing the Law, and the Comfort and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the People received thereby, is plainly and <hi>in terminis</hi> ſet down <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. <hi>And all the People gathered themſelves together as one Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they ſpake unto</hi> Ezra <hi>the Scribe to bring the Book of the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> Ezra <hi>the Priest brought the Law before the Congregation, and he read therein from the Morning until the Mid-day before the Men and the Women, and thoſe that could understand; and</hi> Ezra <hi>the Scribe ſtood upon a Pulpit, and opened the Book in the ſight of all the People;</hi> (and therefore publick Service) <hi>and</hi> Ezra <hi>bleſſed the Lord the great God, and all the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands alſo day by day, from the first day to the last day,</hi> viz. <hi>ſeven days he read in the Book of the Law of God,</hi> v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.18. There is alſo a Promiſe of bleſſing annexed to it, <hi>That the Deaf ſhall hear the Words of the Book of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 29.18. and a Command from the ſame Prophet, <hi>Seek ye out the Book of the Lord, and read.</hi> Ch. 34.16.</p>
               <p>§. Having now out of ſome few of many places of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> made good the Precept and the Practiſe of the Old <hi>Prophets, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> let us now ſee what the <hi>New Teſtament, Christ</hi> and his Apoſtles, will afford us, that by two ſuch unqueſtionable and immutable Witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed; firſt, That Chriſt himſelf is of the ſame Opinion with the Prophet, appears by <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. where he ſaith, <hi>That if they would not hear</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one aroſe from the dead.</hi> Nay, how often doth <hi>Christ</hi> ſend the <hi>Scribes, Phariſes,</hi> and <hi>Saduces</hi> unto the Scripture, ſaying, <q>
                     <hi>How readest thou?</hi> or, <hi>have you not read?</hi> as in the matter of pulling the <hi>Ears of Corn</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> Mat. 12.3.

The Peoples crying <hi>Hoſanna, Mat.</hi> 21.16. and concerning the Stone which the Builders refuſed, 42. and the Reſurrection of the Dead, <hi>C.</hi> 22.31. nay, when he came to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he had been brought up, and, as his cuſtom was, he went into the Synagogue on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and <hi>stood up for to read,</hi> Luke 4.16. and <hi>Paul coming to</hi> Antioch, <hi>went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day,</hi> and ſate down, and after the <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Law and the Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Rulers of the Synagogne ſent unto them, that if they had any word of Exhortation to the People, to go on;</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> declared, and laid the condemning of Jeſus to the charge of thoſe that dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and their Rulers, becauſe they knew him not,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50679:70"/>nor yet the Voices of the Prophets, which <hi>are read every Sabbath-day, Acts</hi> 13.14, 15.27, 28. So the Apoſtles and Elders being ſolemnly met together in Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> declared, that <hi>Moſes</hi> of old time had in every City them that preached Chriſt, being <hi>read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day,</hi> Acts 15.24.</q> By which it ſeems in the eſteem of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> in thoſe days, that <hi>reading</hi> was eſteemed <hi>preaching;</hi> and the reſult of their meeting being written in an Epiſtle, and delivered to the Churches, and <hi>read,</hi> they <hi>rejoyced for the Conſolation,</hi> 30.31.

The <hi>Sermons</hi> of our <hi>Priests,</hi> and of our days, are not ſo the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Sermons</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were: nay they are but <hi>quodam modo</hi> and <hi>interpretativè,</hi> term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods Word, becauſe his Word is the Subject of which they treat, and <hi>Liturgies</hi> in this ſenſe are or ſhould be as much the Word of God, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for the Wit and Gifts of Man gives equally the Being and Form to them both. Will you <hi>confine the Spirit,</hi> and aſcribe Vital Operation to Sermons alone, or to the Adminiſtrations of every Individual Prieſt only, and not unto thoſe compoſed by Bodies Collective? Is that to divide the Word aright, nay, is it not partial diſpenſation, ſo to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> to derogate from, and to deprive one Gift and Way of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its juſt Efficacy and Operation, and to attribute it wholly to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gift of the ſame Stamp? Nay, is it not imparting the moſt peculiar Glory of the Word of God unto that, which is not properly his Word, nor no more his Word than <hi>Liturgies</hi> are? <hi>Apostolick Sermons</hi> were, no doubt, unto ſuch as heard them, the Word of God; and are not their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſo now to us? Sermons are not the only Preaching, which doth ſave Souls: Writing or reading of what is written and ſpoken; ſpeaking either <hi>extempore</hi> or premeditately do differ indeed, yet not ſo, but that they may all ſerve to one and the ſelf-ſame general, if not particular End and Effect, and in our Caſe to the <hi>edification of the Church.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> indeed could not write with their Tongues; but they did preach as well with their Pens when they writ, as with their Tongues when they ſpake the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and our uſual publick reading of the Word of God, with the reſt of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> for the Peoples inſtruction, (by his good leave) is <hi>Preaching, Acts</hi> 15.21, 22. Can any Man imagine, or ſhew a Reaſon, that <hi>reading</hi> it ſelf is not one of the ordinary Means and Gifts, which God hath appointed for the conveying of his Truths into the Hearts of Men; which being received, may be effectual for the ſaving of their Souls? Belief in all Sorts doth come by hearing and attending to the Word of Life, whether it be <hi>preached</hi> or <hi>read.</hi> The Word it ſelf, whether <hi>read</hi> or <hi>heard,</hi> ſome time convinceth the Judgment, and perſwadeth the Affections. Sometime Truth is wrought in the Heart by private conference and inſtruction from private Perſons; ſo <hi>Apollos,</hi> though an <hi>Eloquent Man, and mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> yet <hi>was taught the Way of God more perfectly by</hi> Aquila, <hi>and Priſcilla</hi> a Woman, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26. Some Truth is taught by thoſe whom the <hi>Church</hi> hath publickly called to the publick <hi>reading</hi> or interpreting of the Word. All theſe tend unto one and the ſame Glorious End, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Knowledge of Jeſus, and him Crucified.</hi> And as Preaching (which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining by lively Voice, and applied according to the Wiſdom of the Speaker) doth not in its own Nature juſtle out or prejudice the Efficacy of any other means or way of publick Inſtruction, be it by <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or inforce the utter diſability of any other means thought requiſite in this <hi>Church</hi> for the ſaving of Souls: <hi>So Liturgies in their own Nature are not excluſive of any other proviſion of Means that Christ hath ordained for the benefit and ſervice of his Church,</hi> as this Diſcourſer avers: For the ſaving Force of the Word is not reſtrained to any one certain kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; but how ever the ſame ſhall come to be made known, it hath its

O! but though <hi>Liturgies</hi> are not in their own Natures excluſive of the uſe of other Talents, yet the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> (there is the grand Pique) doth avowedly and expreſly ſay, <q>That the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhall not uſe or exerciſe any Spiritual Gift in the Adminiſtration of thoſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for which proviſion is made in the Book, <hi>f.</hi> 67, 68. And conſequently the neceſſary and undiſpenſable Uſe of Liturgies is directly excluſive of the Uſe of the Means provided by Chriſt, and for the End for which the Liturgy is invented and impoſed, 63, 67, 68. And farther he ſaith, That the <hi>Liberty</hi> which ſome ſay is granted for a Man to uſe his own Gifts and Abilities in Prayer before and after Sermon will he fears, (as things now ſtand) upon due Conſiderations appear rather to be <hi>taken</hi> than <hi>given,</hi> and is very queſtionable, 42, 43. And that however it concerns not our preſent Queſtion, becauſe it is taken for granted by thoſe that plead for the ſtrict obſervation of a Book, that the <hi>whole Goſpel-worſhip of God</hi> in the Aſſembly of Chriſtians may be carried on and performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch Preaching as is prefaced with that <hi>Liberty</hi> pretended, 42, 43. and for that many that are looked upon as skilled in that Law and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of it, do by their practiſe give another Interpretation of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Impoſition, making it extend to all that is done in publick Worſhip, the bare preaching or reading of a Sermon or Homily except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 64. nor, ſaith he, is that the matter enquired into, whether Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may at any time, or in any part of Gods Worſhip, make uſe of their Gifs; but whether they may do it <hi>in all thoſe Administrations,</hi> for whoſe performance to the edification of his Body they are beſtowed on them by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> which, by the Rule of the Liturgy, we have ſhewed <hi>that they may not;</hi> and he doubts not but it will be granted by thoſe who contend for the Impoſition of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> that it extends to the Principal Parts, if not to the Whole of the publick Worſhip of God in the Church, 64.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. If all were true that is here alledged, the day might probably be his own: but, me thinks in thus arguing our Author is not ſo candid as his other very Learned and Ingenious Writings ſpeak him to be, when he deals with others in Points of difference of a far more <hi>dangerous concern</hi> and conſequence: For though he cannot but moſt aſſuredly and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively know that here all Miniſters of the Goſpel have not only a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but are expreſly commanded to uſe and improve their Talents even in publick, as often as they are called, either to implore Bleſſings, or deprecate Sins, and Judgments, to render Thanks, or to diſcourſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large themſelves on all or any part of the Worſhip of God, or Chriſtian Doctrine, and that it is the daily practiſe of them ſo to do throughout all the Kings Dominions: yet for him to ſay that it is <hi>a Liberty rather taken than given, and is very questionable,</hi> and that upon what this Man ſays, and that Man thinks or practiſes, is not to be ingenious according to his old wont; but to avoid all Sophiſtry, and to come to the demonſtration of the Truth, this is meer matter of Fact, and we cannot erre in it, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of which will and muſt clear this Point, and we muſt ſtand and fall thereby; and therefore <hi>ſit liber Judex,</hi> together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe of the <hi>Church</hi> from the very Birth and firſt <hi>Introduction</hi> of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50679:72"/>our <hi>Liturgy</hi> unto this very day, for we muſt take both together: for that, the conſtant and uninterrupted Practiſe, Uſe, and Cuſtom, is of that very great Force and Vertue, as ſometimes to wear out and obliterate the very Force and Vertue of an Enacted Law to the contrary. The Matter of Fact alledged on his part is, That <hi>the Liturgy ſays expreſly, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Goſpel ſhall not uſe nor exerciſe any Spiritual Gift,</hi> &amp;c. but how or where to find this in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> I know not; for I have turned it over once and again, and cannot find the leaſt footſteps of any ſuch Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet I will not affirm that it is not there. It's poſſible I may have over-look'd it; but grant it be <hi>in terminis,</hi> as he hath worded it, yet if from the firſt Inſtitution of <hi>Liturgies</hi> the Uſe and Practiſe hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as moſt certainly it hath been, and no Man ever queſtioned for uſing his Talents, nay all commanded <hi>by Injunctions and Acts of Parliament</hi> to improve them, and ſtrict Inquiry made accordingly at the Biſhops Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations according unto Articles of Viſitation; then undoubtedly no ſuch Prohibition was ever intended by the Impoſition of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> what ever the words may import: Indeed in the late Act of Uniformity it is Enacted, <q>That no Form or Orders of Common-Prayers, Adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Rites and Ceremonies ſhall be openly uſed in any Church or Chappel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> other than what is preſcribed and appointed to be uſed in and by the ſaid Book: What doth this hinder, but that every Prieſt may uſe his own Talents in praying before and after Sermon, and in his Sermons to illuſtrate or declare any thing that beſt pleaſeth him concerning any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Ordinance, or Adminiſtration: This may be a Prohibition of the Uſe of any other Form or Book, Popiſh, Turkiſh, or other to be uſed in publick in the Nature of a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but can never be fairly interpreted to be a Prohibition of the Uſe of Miniſters Talents, which they may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to exerciſe in their Oraiſons, Preachings, Collations, Catechiſings, or other Teachings in publick. Nay, were the words as he relates them, yet the general and conſtant practiſes of the <hi>Church</hi> having been diametrically contrary to thoſe very words and ſenſe of them, doth manifeſt to all the World, that the Intendment of them was never to be <hi>excluſive</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Miniſters Gifts and Graces in the publick Worſhip of God, as this Author ſuggeſts it to be: Nay, ſuppoſe there were ſuch a Prohibition in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and that it were to be ſtrictly obſerved, (which were as much as in them lieth to null the very Ordinance of God, and to ſtifle his Spirit, which blows where it liſteth) yet that makes nothing againſt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies in General,</hi> that may be compoſed and enjoyned without any ſuch Sting or Venom in the Tail of them: Surely our Author cannot intend, that whilſt he is reading of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or adminiſtring according unto it, either of the Sacraments, or any of the Ordinances, that he cannot uſe his own Talents <hi>eodem momento;</hi> if he ſhould thus vainly argue, I muſt then refer him unto the Commands and Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, and unto the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26, 27. where all things are commanded to be done for Order, and Decency, and in courſe, one ſpeaking after another, and one Gift uſed after another, <hi>for God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> v. 33. I did at firſt reſolve to wave the Juſtifying of the Particulars of any one, or other <hi>Liturgy;</hi> but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably caſt upon it, I muſt go on a little farther, though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my reſolution and deſign: We have already conſidered Matter of Fact on the behalf of the Author, let us ſee now Matter of Fact making againſt him in the very Body of our Common-Prayer-Book. After the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50679:72"/>
                  <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> &amp;c. it ordains, That then ſhall follow the Sermon, which is far from a Command; <hi>That Ministers ſhall not uſe or exerciſe any Spiritual Gift,</hi> &amp;c. the ſame Book alſo directs, That the Curate of every Pariſh ſhall, after the Second Leſſon at Evening Prayer, openly in the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and examine Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſo far from <hi>prohibiting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Ministers Gifts and Talents,</hi> that it commands the exerciſe of them: Then conſult <hi>the Book of Ordering Priests and Deacons,</hi> and then you will find, that the Biſhops give many pious Exhortations to thoſe that are to be ordained, <q>
                     <hi>declaring it to be their Duty and Office to inſtruct, preach, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, teach, ſeed, and provide for the Lords Family, and withal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diligence to uſe both publick and private Admonitions and Exhortations as well to the Sick as to the Whole,</hi> &amp;c.</q> and then ordaining them, bids them to be faithful <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and of his <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Are not theſe Liberties, nay Commands, that they ſhall not <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin-up</hi> their Talents, but ſhall employ and put them out unto Feneration Spiritual and Heavenly? Then conſult all the <hi>Injunctions and Articles of Viſitation</hi> from the days of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. unto this our Age, and you will find them all full of like Commands, Exhortations, Inquiries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall only trouble you with ſome few things out of the very firſt Injunctions, as the <hi>pureſt</hi> in the days of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6, 15.47. <q>where all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving care of Souls, are enjoyned to the uttermoſt of their Wit, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Learning, ſincerely and purely to teach in their Sermons the Word of God, and in the ſame exhort their Hearers to the Works of Faith, Mercy and Charity ſpecially preſcribed and commanded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and that Works deviſed by Mens Phantaſies beſides Scripture, as Pilgrimages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are deteſted and abhorred by God; they are therein alſo charged to exhort and counſel by all the ways and means they may, as well in their Sermons, and Collations, as otherwiſe, Fathers, Mothers, Maſters, to beſtow their Children and Servants in Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they provide that the Sacraments be duly and reverently miniſtred in their Pariſhes: Nay, they are in thoſe Injunctions charged, that if any do or ſhall know any Man within their Pariſh, or elſewhere, that is, a Letter of the Word of God to be read in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or ſincerely preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall diſcover them to the Council, or the next Juſtice of Peace, in order to their puniſhment, <hi>ſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</q> The ſame Injunctions command, That the Sabbath be ſpent in hearing <hi>the Word of God read and taught</hi> in private and publick Prayers, <hi>&amp;c. Arch-biſhop Cranmer,</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of theſe <hi>Injunctions, by his Articles of</hi> Viſitation the ſame year made Inquiry, <hi>Whether the Ministers did preach purely and ſincerely the Word of God in every of their Cures.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom, Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering, and Doctrine.</hi> And in the Body of them there are ſeveral Articles of Inquiry after the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> one whereof is, <hi>Whether any do preach any thing in derogation of the Book of Common-Prayer:</hi> And not without good cauſe, for that it was the Decree of a very Ancient Council, that no Man ſhould be admitted to ſpeak againſt that whereunto he had formerly ſubſcribed; and it is againſt the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to ſpeak againſt the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed, <hi>Confer.</hi> 26, 27. in the Year 1564. there were Articles framed purpoſely for Doctrine and Preaching:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50679:73"/>Much after the ſame Tenor and purport have all our ſubſequent Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Articles, Canons, and Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical in our ſeveral Princes Reigns been: Nay in our very <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> there is much concerning <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Preaching:</hi> And is it then poſſible, that all this ſhould be, and yet <q>the <hi>liberty which ſome ſay is granted for a Man to uſe their own Gifts and Abilities ſhould appear rather to be taken than given, as this Author ſuggests.</hi>
                  </q> Certainly this great Cloud of Witneſſes will cure our Author of this his fear, and ſet him and all others right as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact in this Point, and ſo I leave it.</p>
               <p>§. Other Objections he makes againſt <hi>Liturgies,</hi> if impoſed, as that they occaſion neglect, and diſabilities; <hi>that they hinder the due Exerciſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Spiritual Gifts, and that they are an unwarrantable Abridgement of that Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free; and therefore ſin in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Impoſition thereof.</hi> Theſe I take to be rather Libels, than juſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, for that there is no property belonging unto a good Paſtor but what is very conſiſtent with the true Nature and Uſe of <hi>ſound Liturgies,</hi> as hath been ſhewed already. But if there be any ſuch Watch-men <hi>that are blind, ignorant, dumb Dogs that cannot bark, ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber, greedy Dogs which can never have enough, lazy, idle Shepherds that cannot understand,</hi> Iſa. 56.10, 11. that will take occaſion from the <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Liturgies</hi> to <hi>neglect to feed their Flocks, to strengthen the Diſeaſed, to heal the Sick, to bind up that which is broken, and to ſeek that which is lost;</hi> yet this cannot without ſlander be imputed unto the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or their <hi>Impoſition,</hi> but unto the Shepherds themſelves, <hi>who will exact their due, but neglect their Duty, who take the hire of Labourers, but live as Loiterers, who love Pride, fulneſs of Bread, and abundance of Idleneſs, and to feed themſelves, and not the Lords Flock,</hi> Ezek. 34.3. looking to their own ways every one for his gain from his Quarter, ſaying, <hi>We will fetch Wine, and fill our ſelves with Strong Drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56.10, 11, 12. (the more ſhame for thoſe that ordain ſuch, and put ſuch into Preferments) and no doubt but God will in his due time require his Flock at the Hands of ſuch Paſtors, and <hi>feed them with judgment, cauſing their Habitation to mourn, and themſelves to howl, for that God will ſpoil their Glory,</hi> Zech. 11.3. for indeed I know no power that <hi>Goſpel-Ministers</hi> can undoubtedly challenge by their Charter from Heaven, <hi>but to preach in ſeaſon out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to teach their Flock, and duly to</hi> Adminiſter Gods Ordinances and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. And if this ſhould be denied them by <hi>vertue</hi> of the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or that <hi>Liturgies</hi> were <hi>really excluſive of that Proviſion of Means that Christ hath ordained for the Edification of his Church</hi> (as this Author ſeems to brand them) it were better that both <hi>Liturgies</hi> and my ſelf were tied to a Mil-ſtone and both caſt into the midſt of the Sea, than that I ſhould thus plead for them; but being clearly convinced of the contrary, I ſhall go to that which is laſt to be touched, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. That Liturgies, if impoſed, are againſt <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> I muſt confeſs is a ſpecious, and glorious term, a moſt precious and moſt excellent thing, an ineſtimable Bleſſing purchaſed by the death of the Son of God Jeſus Chriſt bleſſed for ever; and therefore ought not to be infringed or impeached by any, and let him be <hi>Anathema</hi> that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50679:73"/>would willingly and knowingly endeavour it. And as it is a thing of very high concern to all Chriſtians, ſo it is very apt to be highly wreſted and abuſed contrary to the holy Ghoſt by Chriſtians of divers perſwaſions, every man Writing and ſhaping it to his own humor, and fancying to themſelves <hi>liberty</hi> in ſuch and ſuch things, and then wreſting places to favour their fancies, which were never ſo intended by the Holy Ghoſt, which crime is chiefly charged and falls moſt heavily upon the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who do embrace an opinion very Licentious, Extravagant, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all Government, holding <hi>that a Chriſtian Mans Liberty is lost, and the Soul which Christ hath Redeemed unto himſelf, injuriouſly drawn into Servitude under the Yoak of Humane power, if any Law be now impoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Goſpel of Jeſus Christ, in obedience whereunto the Spirit of God, and not the conſtraint of Men is to lead us according to that of the Bleſſed Apoſtle, ſuch as are lead by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14. and not ſuch as live in Thraldom unto Men, therefore their Judgment is, that amongſt Chriſtians there muſt be no Magiſtrates, for if there muſt be Magiſtrates, they muſt have Power to make Laws beſides the Laws of God, but this Power they have not, becauſe Chriſtians have a free uſe of all the Creatures of God by <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> Next unto the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> it falls heavy (I wiſh I could ſay not Juſtly) upon ſome ſcrupulous Non-conformiſts, that under pretence of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> wherein they ſay they ought <hi>to stand fast</hi> (and ſo no doubt they ought) they often deny obedience to the Lawful Commands of the Magiſtrate, <hi>in the buſineſs of the Lord,</hi> and ſo uſe <hi>(or rather abuſe) their Liberty,</hi> for a Cloak to cover their malitiouſneſs, I will not ſay but their miſunderſtandings, and not as the Servants of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. There are others of the like <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Libertines;</hi> as <hi>Phanaticks, Quakers, Ranters, Adamites, &amp; others.</hi> But becauſe they are Perſons having no Principles, no Mediums whereon to Ground and Regulate Diſcourſes or Diſputations, I ſhall wave and a little, look into the true nature of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> which according to <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome higher thing than the Liberty in the uſe of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and which I take to be a Spiritual Right or Condition in all the parts of it, becauſe it pertains to Conſcience. Be the extent of this Liberty what it will in it ſelf, it is inwardly in the Conſcience: But the publick uſe of it being in outward things and Actions, is therefore under the Order of Humane Laws, becauſe Liberty is in Conſcience, and the Magiſtrates Authority pertains to the Body.</p>
               <p>§. For to make all reſtraint of the Outward Man in matters indifferent,<note place="margin">Confer. at <hi>Hamp.</hi> Court, 70, 71.</note> an Impeachment of <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> what were it elſe, but even to bring Flat <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> and <hi>Anarchy</hi> into <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and to overthrow all bounds of Subjection and Obedience to lawful Authority? For wherein can the immediate Power and Authority of Rulers conſiſt, or the due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Inferiours be ſhown, if not in indifferent and Arbitrary things? For things <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> and commanded by God we are bound to do, whether Humane Authority required them or no, and things <hi>abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> as Prohibited by God, we are bound not to do, whether Humane Authority forbid them or no, there are no other things left then, wherein to expreſs properly the obedience due to Superiour Authority, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, <hi>In rebus mediis lex poſita est obedientiae,</hi> Bern. Ep. if any retort, as ſome have done, that if we are obliged to do things <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> and commanded by God, and obliged not to do things abſolutely
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50679:74"/>
                  <hi>unlawful</hi> and forbidden by God without the Interpoſition of Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then there are no things left for the exerciſe of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> but only things indifferent, among which <hi>Liturgies</hi> may be reckoned, which <hi>Liberty</hi> if invaded or infringed by any Humane Authority: A great Goſpel priviledge is thereby infringed which ought not to be: Then I muſt retort on them alſo and return their own Weapons upon themſelves; if every reſtraint in things indifferent be injurious to Chriſtian Liberty: then themſelves are no leſs Injurious by their Negative Reſtraint, <hi>viz. uſe no Liturgy, wear not,</hi> croſs not, kneel not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like that <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1. <hi>touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> then they would have the World believe our Church is by <hi>her poſitive restraint</hi> unto the uſe of our <hi>Liturgies</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> therewith uſed, let themſelves be Judged, whether it is more Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to <hi>Christian Liberty, Publick Authority,</hi> by mature advice Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what may be forborn, or <hi>Private Spirits</hi> through humourous diſlikes, or at beſt not upon any demonſtrative reaſons forbidding what may be uſed, the <hi>whole Church Impoſing</hi> the uſe, <hi>Or a few Diſſenters</hi> requiring the forbearance of ſuch things as are otherwiſe, and in themſelves equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different for uſe or for forbearance. Beſides, if I am not much miſtaken, the true Nature of <hi>Evangelical Liberty,</hi> as intimated before, conſiſts chiefly, if not wholly, about things of a higher ſtrain and Nature, than of matters Indifferent, and it will be very hard to prove (by any one plain Text of Scripture without Wreſting) the <hi>Liberty</hi> ſo much contended for, to be their Goſpel and inviolable right, when the Power of the Magiſtrate doth interpoſe <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con.</hi> For if indifferent things be the only ſubject matter both of Publick Chriſtian Authority, and of Chriſtian Private <hi>Liberty</hi> in every Individual Chriſtian, whereon to exerciſe themſelves, then the whole Gitt of the Conteſt will be, whether Publick Authority, or every Private Perſon be to be Indulged and Obeyed, Judge, even ye your ſelves, Judge.</p>
               <p>§. Now, the beſt way to my apprehenſion to underſtand <hi>what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in their Writings</hi> do mean and intend by the Words and Terms of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> will be, to conſider them with their oppoſites, <hi>viz. Bondage</hi> and <hi>Servitude,</hi> and this St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth (as in other of his Epiſtles ſo) moſt fully and moſt plainly in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues theſe two oppoſite Terms Allegorically, under the two Titles of two Mothers, the one <hi>viz. Agar</hi> a Servant gendring unto <hi>Bondage,</hi> the other <hi>viz. Sarah</hi> a Free Woman gendring unto <hi>Freedom,</hi> thereby ſignifying the Two <hi>Testaments, viz.</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and thereby ſhewing that the <hi>Jews</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> were as Children differing nothing from Servants, but were under Tutors and Governours, and in <hi>Bondage</hi> under the Rudiments of the World: <hi>i.e. the Law or Miniſtry of</hi> Moſes ſo called, in reſpect of a more full and <hi>clear Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Now the <hi>Law</hi> is a grievous Yoak which none can bear, becauſe Firſt it did bind the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to the Obſervation of many, and thoſe very coſtly and burthenſome Ceremonies and Sacrifices. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did bind every Offender to everlaſting death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 13.3. it is a Yoak, as it increaſeth Sin, (not caſually but occaſionally) and as it is the ſtrength of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 20.7, 8. and whoſe property it is to gender unto Bondage. But after the fullneſs of time was come, and Chriſt had Redeemed them that were under the Law, they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50679:74"/>did then receive the Adoption of Sons. God had ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into their Hearts, they were then no more Servants but Sons, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as enjoy the liberty of Sons, and <hi>were Free indeed, becauſe the Son had made them Free, John</hi> 8.36. ſo <hi>Agar</hi> which typifieth the Law, is in Bondage with her Children, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above and typifieth the Goſpel, is free, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25, 26.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> conſiſts, firſt in our being <hi>delivered from the Curſe of the Law</hi> for the breach thereof, and from the Obligation of the <hi>Law,</hi> whereby it binds us to bring perfect righteouſneſs in our Own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons according unto, <hi>do this and live.</hi> Secondly, From the <hi>Obſervation of the Ceremonial Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Col.</hi> 2.16.

               <p>I have peruſed theſe and divers others, if not all the places of Scripture urged by ſeveral of the Synagogue of the <hi>Libertines,</hi> whereby they lay claim unto their exhorbitant, dearly beloved, and much Idolized <hi>Liberty,</hi> to do what they liſt without controle or Inſpection into their Actings, in and about Holy things, and do (and whoſoever ſhall ſoberly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider them together with their Contexts ſhall) find them all to Center into their own one and the ſame moſt naturall and genuine ſence and meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> in them mentioned, is <hi>mainly if not meerly</hi> meant the <hi>Liberty</hi> from the Yoak, Bondage, and Curſe of the Law, it being a Spiritual liberty in all the parts of it, freeing the true Chriſtian from the Servitude of Sin, and from all other Yoaks of Spiritual Bondage, wherewith Sin hath intangled us, and from which Chriſt the Author of this <hi>Liberty</hi> hath redeemed us and <hi>that the Law of this Liberty is the Goſpel,</hi> and that neither in the Texts of Scripture urged by this Author, nor in any other that I know of, is there any one Syllable of force to ſupport the <hi>Liberty</hi> that this Author ſeems to plead for, that is Impeached or Contradicted by the Impoſition of ſound Orthodox <hi>Liturgies.</hi> Moſtly all the Texts wherein <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> are but Named, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Muſtred up as a Cloud of Witneſſes to ſhadow and ſhelter the Pleaders for their fancyed <hi>Liberty,</hi> that under the pretence and umbrage of them and their corrupt gloſſes upon them they may with the better grace deny obedience to the Lawful Magiſtrate in Lawful things in and about the Worſhip of God, and ſo uſe or rather abuſe their true Goſpel Liberty (which no man can take from them) for a Cloak to cover their Non-compliance with the Lawful Commands of the Civil Magiſtrate, which indeed are the Commands of the <hi>National Church,</hi> which to do, is certainly <hi>not to approve themſelves unto God, Workmen that need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. but by thus perverting and ſhaping Texts of Scripture to ſuit with their own fancies, they walk and diſpute <hi>in Craftineſs, handling the word of God deceitfully, and do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God, by manifeſtation of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:50679:75"/>
               <p>§. Here I muſt call to mind the General <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> or admonition laid down in the beginning of this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 4. without any particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection or reſpect unto this or that Author or Sect of any perſwaſion, being as lyable my ſelf to the laſh thereof, as any other if a tranſgreſſor. In my opinion (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments) all the Texts mentioned by this our Author, do mainly if not meerly intend a Liberty from the Yoak and Curſe of the Law. For firſt Chriſtian Liberty is oppoſed to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Bondage, and Servitude to that Yoak and Curſe which lay upon them, and from which the Goſpel freed them. Now that Goſpel freed them and us, firſt from the Curſe of the Moral Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 10.13. not from the obedience of that Law, the obligation of it is Eternal and Indiſpenſable, Parents, Miniſters, and Magiſtrates, are as much to be obeyed now as then. Secondly, From the Yoak and Burthen of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10, 28. This Law was abrogated at the death of Chriſt as to its obligation, and though it was obſerved by the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſome time after, even by St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 21.20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not neceſſary, <hi>ex obligatione &amp; vi legis,</hi> but voluntarily ſubmitted unto in Chriſtian prudence to gain the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This is that <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> which Chriſt purchaſed for us, and the <hi>Bondage</hi> from which he freed us, and would have us ſtand faſt in the maintaining of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. And let us now ſee how candidly this Author deals herein with his Scripture Quotations. Of this <hi>Liberty</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us by Jeſus Chriſt, ſo far as it relates to the Worſhip of God he makes two parts; firſt a Freedom from thoſe Pedagogical Inſtitutions of God himſelf, which by his own appointment, were to continue only to the time of Reformation, <hi>F.</hi> 69. this we will not queſtion. Secondly, a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſubjection to the Authority of Men, as to any new Impoſition in or about the Worſhip of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. And the ſame Rule is given out as to our duty and deportment in reference unto both theſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>f.</hi> 70. unto this ſecond part of Liberty only, I muſt crave leave to give check, and ask what he means by <hi>New Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If by <hi>New Impoſition</hi> be meant a new and falſe kind of Worſhip, or Doctrines that are not agreeable to the word of truth, but are plainly and clearly contrary thereunto, I ſay ſo too, but if thereby be meant a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (and another cannot ſignificantly be intended, having ſet up that for his mark and inſtance) not commanding nor expreſſing any new diviſed, or other Doctrine or Worſhip than what is agreeable to the Goſpel of Truth, and other I defend not (and his main force is bent againſt <hi>Liturgies</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) I ſhall take <hi>Liberty</hi> to be a diſſenting Brother until better informed. If I ſhould appeal to himſelf, that if he had the ſame <hi>Liberty</hi> allowed him that he contends for, would he not adorn and deliver this Goſpel Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Truth, and Doctrines in his own dreſs of flouriſhing Retorick Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Expreſſions, whereof he is a great Maſter. And is the <hi>Liturgy</hi> any more or other than Goſpel-Worſhip, Truth, and Doctrines expreſſed, and made manifeſt by the various expreſſions of men, as capable of the ſame knowledge, and of the dictates and illapſes of the ſame Spirit as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? O! but its Impoſition, and the neceſſity of its obſervance by virtue of that Impoſition, is the grand Pique indeed, that cannot be digeſted, it being in his Judgment, very unreaſonable to impoſe forms on others, who <q>deſire to ſtand faſt in the <hi>Liberty with which Christ hath made them free, f.</hi> 31. <hi>God having never delegated his power to any to appoint or institute any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50679:75"/>thing in his Worſhip or about it, that ſeemeth meet unto their Wiſdom, f.</hi> 50.</q> this I take to be generally true, that whatſoever is lawful to be uſed without Impoſition, may lawfully be impoſed, and as lawfully uſed when impoſed, therefore Impoſition or not Impoſition alters not the Caſe but is quite out of Doors: then this <hi>Liberty</hi> rightly ſtated, rightly underſtood and not wreſted, is not denyed to this Author, nor unto any other that I know of, no nor yet ſo abridged by the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but that he may have his deſire and ſtand faſt therein. But how he will prove this <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> to extend to ſuch Dimenſions and Latitudes as he pretends a right unto, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus.</hi> For though God never deligated his power to any without conſideration of right or wrong to introduce a new or other falſe Worſhip, yet ſure this Author upon Second and better thoughts and conſiderations, will not deny but that God hath delegated power to ſome on earth, that are no Prieſts, to regulate and Order ſome things in and about his own Worſhip, that ſeemeth meet unto their Wiſdoms that are not contrary thereunto, as to appoint publick places for the Congregation to meet in, and to ſee that they do meet accordingly, and to appoint Paſtors to read and Preach his word, and Adminiſter his Sacraments rightly and duly, and to provide a maintenance, that they that ſerve at the Altar may live of the Altar, that all things may be done decently and in order, among which (ſome things) <hi>Liturgies</hi> may juſtly claim a Room, and to be impoſed.</p>
               <p>§. Now let us examine his Scripture Proofs, The firſt Text he brings to prove his Second Part of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> (having divided it into two parts as before,) <hi>viz. that we have a Freedom from Subjection to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Men, as to any New Impoſitions in or about the Worſhip of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Art thou called being a Servant? care not for it; but if thou maist be made Free, uſe it rather.</hi> What of this? Doth this prove that we have a Freedom from Subjection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto me any Sentence out of the <hi>Apocrypha, Alcaron,</hi> or <hi>Talmud</hi> might have been as good a Proof. The Scope of the Apoſtle in that verſe (and indeed almoſt of that whole Chapter) being only to perſwade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto contentedneſs of mind, in what Eſtate or condition of life ſoever they ſhall be called unto or placed in, and therefore in the Verſe immediately before, he Commands, <hi>that every Man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called,</hi> v. 20. and then follows, <hi>art thou called to be a Servant,</hi> &amp;c. and in the ſubſequent Verſes he reaſons it thus, <hi>For he that is called in the Lord being a Servant, is the Lords Free-man,</hi> likewiſe, <hi>he that was called being Free, is Chriſts Servant,</hi> v. 22. and then follows, <hi>let every Man herein abide with God,</hi> v. 24. By all which the Apoſtle only teacheth, that all men ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their Vocation, yet not ſo tyed, as it were by a perpetual and unalterable Law, that they may not be at Liberty to alter their Condition, when juſt Cauſe ſo requireth; and this he makes good by way of inſtancing the Condition of Servants, with words of Conſolation, that though they are Servants to men, yet they being once made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that Grace of Chriſt, may notwithſtanding in Spirit and Truth ſerve the Lord Chriſt, whoſe <hi>Service is perfect Freedom;</hi> and withall teacheth, that Liberty being far more Excellent and Commodious than Bondage, is rather to be choſen when opportunely it may be had. But in all this, not one Syllable towards the making good of his Aſſertion, <hi>viz. A Freedom from ſubjection to the Authority of Men,</hi> &amp;c. He then proceeds
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50679:76"/>to affirm that <hi>the ſame Rule is given out, as to our duty and deportment in reference unto both theſe,</hi> viz. the two parts of liberty divided by him as before, which he endeavours to provo by <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. but with what ſucceſs will appear upon their Scanning, <hi>stand faſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us Free, and be not intangled again with the Yoak of Bondage, Gal.</hi> 5.1. I moſt willingly confeſs the force that this place hath, for the juſtifying of his firſt part of <hi>Christian Liberty:</hi> but as to the Juſtifying of the ſecond part, I conceive with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, that it is of no validity at all. The <hi>Liberty</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> (the <hi>Apoſtle of uncircumciſion</hi>) beſides the general Intendment and reſpect it had to the general Freedom from the Obligation, Bondage, and Curſe of the Law, purchaſed by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> it did more particularly reſpect <hi>Circumciſion</hi> a part of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which might have been performed in <hi>Titus,</hi> as it had been before in <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, had not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>falſe Brethren, who came in privily to ſpy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jeſus, that they might bring us into Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Gal.</hi> 2.4. Bondage! What Bondage? Subjection to the Authority of Men, commanding Lawful things about the Worſhip of God? Nothing leſs, but <hi>Bondage</hi> by binding them to a neceſſary obſervance of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law,</hi> by teaching the <hi>neceſſity of Circumciſion</hi> (which before Chriſt was a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and a <hi>Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11. But after the death of Chriſt, till the deſtruction of the Temple, it was <hi>a dead Ceremony,</hi> yet ſome time uſed as a thing indifferent: After the Deſtruction of the Temple, when the Church of the New Teſtament was planted amongſt the Gentiles, it was a deadly Ceremony, and ceaſed to be indifferent,) impoſing it upon <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> making it a meritorious cauſe of Salvation, and teaching Juſtification and Salvation, was partly by Chriſt and partly by the Law, thereby intending <hi>to overthrow the Goſpel of Christ, Gal.</hi> 1.7. againſt this Bondage, this Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> Preached: <hi>behold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that if ye be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, Gal.</hi> 5.2. that is, if you be Circumcized, believing that Circumciſion ſhall be a Meritorious cauſe of your Salvation, and go back from your <hi>Christian</hi> profeſſion and <hi>Liberty, Christ ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in particular, he means generally of the <hi>whole Law, for I teſtifie again to every Man that is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law, Chriſt is become of no effect to you, whoſoever of you are Justified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace,</hi> v. 3, 4. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us Free, and be not intangled again with the Yoak of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> v. 1.</p>
               <p>That this is the moſt natural and genuine (if not only) ſence of this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, will not I think be denied by any Proteſtant: but what farther uſe he can make of this for the Juſtifying his Second part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, without ſtretching and wreſting the words beyond their meaning, is paſt my underſtanding, I am ſure it is not ſafe nor warrantable, to impoſe any other ſence on the Apoſtles words, than what he meant and is clear and evident. After ſuch a deceitful way of handling Scripture, it would be no hard task to prove by Scripture that <hi>there is no God,</hi> that <hi>Prophets are Fools, and that Spiritual men are mad,</hi> Hoſ. 7.</p>
               <p>But we proceed to his other places of Scripture (which are but two more) and examine if he hath dealt any more candidly, in alledging them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. and <hi>Acts</hi> 15. which we will examine as they lye
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50679:76"/>in Order, the firſt of them is that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which he hath only quoted as he hath done the reſt in Figures, (and not ſet down at length) without making any Application of them, the words are, <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a Cloak of malitiouſneſs, but as the Servants of God.</hi> But by what conſtruction to make this Text favour or make good his Aſſertion, <hi>(viz.) A freedom from ſubjection to the Authority of men, as to any new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in or about the Worſhip of God,)</hi> I muſt confeſs my Self to be <hi>Impar Negotio,</hi> and I believe it to be paſt his Skill alſo, without wreſting the words beyond their Natural meaning. However I will give my Eſſay, by declaring the plain genuine ſence of the place, and freely leave the Reader to Judge and make out the reſt. This Verſe is relative, being the Cloſe or Period of ſomewhat before preſcribed, but more eſpecially of the three laſt Verſes immediately going before, which relates unto and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect obedience and ſubmiſſion to Government. The Text and Context lye thus together. <q>
                     <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governours, as unto them as are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well, for ſo is the will of God, that with well doing he may put to ſilence the ignorance of Fooliſh men, as free, and not uſing your liberty for a Cloak of malitiouſneſs, but as the Servants of God. Honour all Men, Love the Brother-hood, fear God, honour the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.17.</q> The Apoſtles when they Preached the Goſpel-Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> At which falſe Teachers in thoſe dayes did, and ſome in theſe our dayes do take advantage from the very name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> to teach the new Converted Chriſtians, under that pretence to deſpiſe their Governours and Government, did take, and amongſt them our Apoſtle doth here take occaſion from that ground, to endeavour to prevent the abuſes and miſconſtructions of the Glorious and wholſome Doctrine of <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> by teaching that <hi>Christian Subjection</hi> and obedience under the term of <hi>well-doing,</hi> was very conſiſtent with the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and therefore he ſhews it to be the will of God, that they ſhould <hi>ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man, that by ſuch ſubmiſſion, ſuch well doing, they may put to ſilence the ignorance of Fooliſh Men, (viz.)</hi> falſe Teachers and falſe accuſers,) and that this is reinforced with a ſtrong <hi>Debet</hi> ſtampt upon it, <hi>(viz.) this they ought to do for the Lords ſake,</hi> and this they might do as free without the leaſt abridgement of their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and freedom, and that as they had not their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> ſo they ſhould not <hi>uſe it for a Cloak of malitiouſneſs,</hi> (A Garment very ill becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Profeſſors of the Goſpel) but as the <hi>Servants of God ſhould Honour all Men, Love the Brother-hood, Fear God, Honour the King,</hi> and ſo proceed to the Subjection of Servants towards their Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this I conceive to be the natural, and no forced Scope of that part of the Chapter, whence the ſixteenth Verſe was taken, in which conſtruction it more probably rather concludes againſt, than for our Diſcourſer, as being Diametrically oppoſite to the end for which our Author quoted this Apoſtle. However, <hi>ſit lector Judex.</hi> His next and laſt Fortreſs and Refuge is <hi>Acts</hi> 15. which is alſo brought to Juſtifie not only Freedom from <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitutions, but alſo from any ſucceeding Impoſitions of Men, <q>our Liberty equally reſpecting them both, yet he grants there may be, yea that <hi>de facto</hi> there ought to be an Abridgement made of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> as to the performance of ſome things at ſome times, which in general we are made free unto, where the performance in the uſe and exerciſe of our <hi>Liberty</hi> would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50679:77"/>prove an hindrance to Edification, the great thing whereunto all things are ſubſervient. But then the caſe muſt be ſo ſtated <hi>Antecedent</hi> to any Impoſition: that Abridgements of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Diſciples of Chriſt by Impoſitions on them of things, which he hath not appointed, nor made neceſſary by circumſtances <hi>Antecedent</hi> unto ſuch Impoſitions, are plain <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations on the Conſciences of the Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> deſtructive of the liberty which he hath purchaſed for them, and which if it be their duty to walk according to Goſpel Rule, is ſinful to ſubmit unto, and then concludes, that of this nature is the <hi>Impoſition of a Liturgy</hi> contended about, is evident: It having no Inſtitution or appointment by Jeſus Chriſt, it being wholly of men, there being nothing <hi>Antecedent</hi> to its Impoſition, that ſhould make it neceſſary to be Impoſed: A neceſſity of its obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is induced upon and by its Impoſition, which is directly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our <hi>liberty in Jeſus Christ, f.</hi> 70, 71.</q> All which, and much more to the ſame purpoſe, I muſt confeſs our Author hath very perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and very Magiſterially delivered, as if as true as Goſpel it ſelf: but whether in truth they are ſo ſound that they cannot be condemned, and that both my ſelf and others that are of contrary Judgments may be aſhamed, I muſt crave leave to bring this Portion alſo of Scripture <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. <hi>f.</hi> 25.70. to the Teſt, as I have done the others, and leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Judge, he himſelf having only by quoting of it, bid it <hi>Euge</hi> and <hi>Vale,</hi> only giving it a Salute and a Farewel, in one and the ſame breath, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than theſe neceſſary things,</hi> viz. <hi>That ye abſtain from Meats offered to Idols, from Blood, and from things strangled, and from Fornication,</hi> v. 28, 29. <hi>Ergo</hi> what? <hi>Ergo</hi> the Civil Magiſtrates ought not to impoſe a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> containing a wholſome form of ſound words and Worſhip (for of ſuch I muſt be always underſtood.) It muſt conclude ſo much, or it concludes nothing againſt the uſe or Impoſition of ſuch <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and whether ſuch premiſes will yield that Concluſion, I leave the Reader to Judge; Nay, what if this place doth rather conclude for Impoſition than otherwiſe, and that out of his own reaſoning: For he confeſſeth, <hi>f.</hi> 15. that the things there mentioned and impoſed, were <hi>not neceſſary in their own nature, but in the poſture of things in the Churches neceſſary to</hi> the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Scandal, whereby the obſervation of that Injunction was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, which reaſon for ought appears to me, may more rationally yield this concluſion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civil Chriſtian Magiſtrate (which Collectively is as well repreſentative of the Church, as of the Civil State) may impoſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> not abſolutely neceſſary in their own Nature, but neceſſary for the ſake of Order, Uniformity, Peace, and Coveniency of the Church, Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Obedience to the Magiſtrate Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, avoiding of Scandal, preventing of ſundry evils that otherwiſe would enſue. But be it that this Text will Logically yield neither the one Concluſion nor the other; yet let us examine the occaſion of this meeting, and of this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and let the Reader Judge how much or how little it makes for or againſt the <hi>Liberty</hi> the Diſcourſer layes claim unto thereby.</p>
               <p>The true State of the Queſtion which the <hi>Apostles</hi> met to decide at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which believed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> were to be <hi>Circumciſed</hi> or not, and conſequently bound, or not bound to keep the <hi>whole Law:</hi> It was this, to reſolve, That whereas all ſuch as embraced the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> conformed to one of the kinds of <hi>Proſelytes,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50679:77"/>Faederis</hi> or <hi>Januae,</hi> unto whether of them the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which had or ſhould receive the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were to conform themſelves. St. <hi>Peter</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates it to the Council to be the will of God, that they ſhould conform to the latter, and not to the former, becauſe that <hi>Cornelius the first Chriſtned Gentile</hi> (to whom he was ſent) was no Circumciſed Proſelyte, but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte of the Gate, yet received he no Commiſſion to Circumciſe him. Yea the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as he was Preaching, fell on him and his Houſhold being Uncircumciſed, as it did upon thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> whereby it appeared that God would have the reſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which embraced the Faith, to be after the Pattern of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and to have no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them than he had. And accordingly the <hi>Council</hi> defined, that no greater Burthen ſhould be laid upon them than theſe neceſſary things mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. If it ſeemed good to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt himſelf</hi> directing them to impoſe things as neceſſary, that were not ſo in their own Nature, as our Author confeſſeth, ſurely then the more natural and Logical deduction from the Fifteenth of <hi>Acts</hi> is, that for the ſame or other ſound reaſon, and as the poſture of things may ſo ſtand, ſome things not in their own Nature neceſſary, may by Lawful Authority be impoſed for ſome Important conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Here by the way it is fit to be intimated, that in this diſcourſe the terms <hi>Neceſſary and Neceſſity</hi> be rightly underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is to be underſtood not a Doctrinal but an Obediential <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> not <hi>an abſolute Neceſſity, but a Neceſſity,</hi> ex Hypotheſi, <hi>or Neceſſitas convenientiae,</hi> ſo that by neceſſary, is to be underſtood very commendable, very expedient, very Behooful for the weale of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi>

               <p>This done I return to the Fifteenth of <hi>Acts, Jewiſh</hi> Ordinances had ſome things natural in them (which come not in our Verge at this time) and ſome things poſitive, ſome whereof by the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were neceſſary to be aboliſhed, and otherſome indifferent to be kept or not; of the former kind were <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> notwithſtanding, did not ſo teach the preſent and utter Abolition, no not of thoſe things which were neceſſarily to ceaſe, but that even the <hi>Jews</hi> becoming <hi>Christians,</hi> might for a time continue in them, and therefore in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>first Biſhops even till the overthrow thereof, were Circumciſed:</hi> And as for thoſe poſitive things, which might either ceaſe or continue, <hi>prout</hi> the preſent poſture or <hi>State of the Church</hi> ſhould require, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thought it neceſſary to bind even the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for a time to <hi>abſtain</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, from <hi>things offered unto Idols, &amp;c.</hi> In other matters where the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were free, and the <hi>Jews</hi> in their own Judgment ſtill oblidged, the <hi>Apostles</hi> Precept unto the <hi>Jews, Condemn not the</hi> Gentiles: unto the <hi>Gentiles, deſpiſe not the</hi> Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. the one ſort they warned to take heed, that Nicity and Scrupuloſity did not make them rigorous, in giving unadviſed ſentence againſt their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which were free, the other, that they did not become ſcandalous by <hi>abuſing</hi> their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> to the Offence of their weak Brethren, which were ſcrupulous, whereby it is evident that the <hi>Apostle</hi> did impoſe upon the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſome things only in reſpect of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and fitneſs for the preſent State of the Church as it then ſtood; the words of the Councils decree are, <hi>It ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than theſe neceſſary things,</hi> viz. <hi>That ye abstain from meats offered to Idols, &amp;c.</hi> 28, 29. Indeed to have commanded the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to have been conformable to the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe things, which were neceſſarily to ceaſe at the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50679:78"/>been to have <hi>continued a Yoak upon the Diſciples, which neither their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers nor they were able to bear, Acts</hi> 15.10. And indeed to impoſe the like things upon us now, were to bring us again into ſuch <hi>Bondage,</hi> in reſpect (of the Royal and perfect Law of Liberty, <hi>James</hi> 1.25, and 28.) as were inſupportable, to bring us back to Onions and Garlick, and to leave the Land flowing with Milk and Honey. But to conclude from hence the unlawfulneſs of impoſing <hi>Liturgies</hi> as our Author here doth, is ſuch a deduction, ſuch a peace of Scholaſtick Divinity, as is quite paſt my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Notwithſtanding all theſe Texts of Scripture by the Author alledged, I humbly conceive that all the Chriſtian Liberty that can be meant by theſe Texts, is fully allowed to our Diſſenters, and is not in the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached thereby.</p>
               <p>§. There is one Subterfuge yet more left, which is drawn from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this very Council, <hi>viz.</hi> If Impoſition be lawful, yet the <hi>Scandal,</hi> the <hi>Offence,</hi> or <hi>Inconvenience</hi> ought to be <hi>Antecedent to the Impoſition:</hi> And then with much confidence, and very little truth (as I humbly conceive) avers, that <hi>there is no thing Antecedent</hi> unto its (thereby meaning the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi>) <hi>Impoſition that ſhould make it neceſſary to be Impoſed,</hi> either I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not his meaning, or this is a very ſtrange Doctrine, contrary to the very attributes of God, contrary to the very grounds of all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Governments in the World: contrary to the very nature of Wiſdom, for what is it elſe, but to deny even Gods Providence, his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, his preventing Workings and Graces; and to deny in men the uſe of their Prudence, their Reaſon, their Foreſight, and their Forecaſt. Muſt the Old good Axiomes made Venerable by the Univerſal Acceptations of all Ages all the World over, be now thruſt out of doors, and be accounted Fooliſh and Invalid, nay unlawful? <hi>Venienti occurrere morbo, turpius ejici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quam non admittitur hoſtis,</hi> to prevent Diſeaſes, to keep out an Enemy rather than beat him out, are now grown abſolete. Of Old this Axiome was held good, that he <hi>that is ſuddenly ſurpriſed, is half Conquered,</hi> and he that is <hi>forewarned, is half Armed,</hi> nay its two againſt one, a Wiſe man in Peace prepares for War, a Wiſe Marriner prepares in his Haven againſt Leakes and Batteries of Enemies, and violent Storms and Tempeſts. It was wont to go for currant, <hi>that it is too late to provide against an Evil when it is come, and that they are Fools and ill adviſed, that ſay, had I wiſt? or who would have thought it?</hi> But now it ſeems, Evils, at leaſt in the Church, muſt be Antecedent, and conſequently caſt out, not prevented, though foreſeen: ſo that that which hath been approved Wiſdom all the World over, is according to this new light, theſe new Doctrines eſteemed Folly, as a thing of naught, nay unlawful to be uſed.</p>
               <p>However let no man deceive himſelf by thinking there may be ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in theſe Axiomes, or in the perſons Executing or Practiſing them as they may relate to Church or State, to Civil or to Eccleſiaſtical concerns, For in this the ſame wiſdom and Foreſight is equal, indifferently reſpecting both concerns, and the power of Superiours for reſtraint, prevention, or Impoſition equal in both, and the neceſſity of obedience in Inferiors, equal in both. And as no Man hitherto hath been, ſo I think no Man ever will be able to ſhew a real and ſubſtantial difference between them, to make an inequality: But as Civil Magiſtrates may for juſt reaſon of State prohibite and Impoſe concerning ſome things and perſons: So Church Governors may upon as good and juſt reaſons impoſe <hi>Liturgies,</hi> either for preventing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50679:78"/>or removing Idolatry, Superſtition, Scandal, Inconveniences, nay be it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſake of order, or Conformity. Wherefore I do conclude that it is much greater prudence to prevent evils and inconveniencies, than to amend and Reform them when they happen. But what do I trouble my ſelf about this, for that it will not appear to be our caſe,<note place="margin">Scandal and offence did precede the Impoſition of our Liturgy.</note> if our Author be found Tardy in matter of Fact, as I preſume he will, for he ſaith expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, <hi>that there is nothing Antecedent to its impoſition to make it neceſſary to be impoſed:</hi> In which I will joyn Iſſue with him, and let our Church Hiſtory be Judge between us. Whoever knows but little of Church Hiſtory, knows that long before we ever had a <hi>Reformed Liturgie</hi> eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> (the firſt of that nature, and alſo the ſecond, was in the Minority of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.) there was a <hi>Liturgie,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh Breviary</hi> and a <hi>Maſs Book,</hi> long uſed and eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> as full of Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious Doctrines, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and Worſhip as Leaves, which had ſo poyſoned and infected all the Kings Dominions, that it had run into the veins of every Pariſh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Poyſon our <hi>Joſiah-like Prince</hi> and Minor, by the advice of his Spiritual Phyſitians and Councellors ordains ſeveral Antidotes, both to expel that which was Corrupt, and Venemous, and to Ordain and ſet up that which was wholeſom, even a <hi>Liturgy</hi> (as the chief <hi>Turn-key</hi> to let in and to keep out both the pure and impure, ſound and unſound) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>a wholſom form of ſound words</hi> able to prevent the return of the lately expelled <hi>Romiſh</hi> Corruptions, which was accompanied alſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helps, as Commands from the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Proclamations, Injunctions, Viſitations, Instructions, Acts of Parliament,</hi> and indeed what not, that a wiſe and well-meaning Council could ſuggeſt for the advance of a more pure Reformation, all little enough, ſo ſtrangely and ſo univerſally had the former Leaven and Poyſon of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> wrought in the hearts and minds of the generality of this Nation, which <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Remedy</hi> was found to be ſo effectual both for the expelling Idolatrous and Superſtitious Worſhip, under which this Nation had long, and heavily groaned, and alſo for the Propagation of more pure Goſpel-truths and worſhip, that <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was no ſooner quietly Seated on her Throne, but that even by the advice of her Popiſh Council ſhe nulled all that her Brother had done in that behalf, becauſe they had by experience found it ſo effectual for the keeping out of Romiſh Doctrines, and Worſhip, and therefore by a <hi>Statute</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> repealed the <hi>Statutes of</hi> 5 <hi>and</hi> 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. which had been frivolous to have done, had they not found the real effects of it to their prejudice, nay, of ſuch admirable force and vertue was the uſe of that <hi>Liturgy</hi> found to be in thoſe days, and in that conjuncture of affairs, that the wiſdom of the very next ſucceeding Princeſs (who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily had as wiſe a Council, as ever any of her Predeceſſors had) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt likely to be beſt acquainted with the Avail and effects thereof, thought it then alſo the beſt and moſt avaliable means that poſſible could be found by the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil wiſdom of thoſe days, in order to the Readvancement and propogation of the true reformed Religion, ſo happily begun in the days of her moſt excellent Brother, to repeal what <hi>Queen Mary</hi> had done, and to re-eſtabliſh what <hi>Edward</hi> 6, had done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an Act of Uniformity, made 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Eliz.</hi> by all which, and by much more that might be juſtly alleadged it is demonſtrable, that the cauſe was <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the <hi>Impoſition,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh Maſs-Book</hi> before the <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Liturgy.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:50679:79"/>
               <p>If our Author be not yet ſatisfied in this matter of Fact, that at the firſt <hi>reformation ſcandal,</hi> and other neceſſary circumſtances were <hi>Antecedent</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Impoſition of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> I ſhall then beg the favour of him but a little to look back upon the 6 <hi>Ch. of his own Book, fo.</hi> 36.39. and conſider if according to his own Heraldry, his own draught of the Pedegree of our <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Liturgy,</hi> if he give not the Precedency to the <hi>Scandal</hi> (the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> ſo <hi>great a Scandal</hi> that it may be juſtly called a Catholick ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal or Hereſie againſt the very Scripture it ſelf) and not to the <hi>Impoſition</hi> which certainly is as demonſtrable as that <hi>Car.</hi> 1. was before <hi>Car.</hi> 2. And confeſſeth that the ſcandal and Reformation then did ſomewhat reſemble the Scandal and Impoſition mentioned, 15 <hi>Acts.</hi> For after he hath pleaſed himſelf in ſumming up ſome ends and ſome conſiderations, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the then preſent <hi>Reformers</hi> had in framing of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> he then ſays. <hi>And this afterwards accordingly they</hi> (meaning the Prieſts) did, reading the Service-Book inſtead of the Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Scandal</hi> was before the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of our <hi>Liturgy</hi>) <hi>rejecting out of the Offices before in uſe</hi> (what can be more plain) <hi>ſuch things as were directly contrary to the Articles of Faith, profeſſed in the Reformation in hand, Tranſlating of what remained, into</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, <hi>it being before in</hi> Latine, <hi>(Another plain demonstration)</hi> with <hi>ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and alterations, as the rejection of thoſe things beforementioned made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, f.</hi> 39.

               <p>§.

               <p>As Reformation was a Work moſt glorious, ſo it was a work moſt difficult, becauſe it was to <hi>Null</hi> and cancel ſuch Cuſtoms and uſages in Divine Worſhip as tract of time, Age after Age for many Generations had made ſo habitual, and had taken ſuch deep root and Impreſſions in the Hearts and Souls of the People of all ſorts from Father to Son, that in humane reaſon it appeared almoſt impoſſible. And therefore a Work not to be undertaken by blew-Apron or Tradeſmen, nor yet by giddy Phanatick Multitude, nor indeed by any but by the Supream Magiſtrate, and therefore a Work fit only for a <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a King</hi> only as was fit for ſuch a Work, fit to match the <hi>Empreſs of Abominations</hi> and of the World, and ſuch a <hi>King</hi> proved <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, Having great courage and great underſtanding, and great reſolution, without which requiſites he could never have done what he did.</p>

Then by his Injunctions, <hi>May</hi> 6. 1546. he cauſed an Extract to be drawn out of the <hi>Latine</hi> Service con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many of the beſt and moſt edifying Prayers, which with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany he cauſed to be made <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that the People might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Prayers of the Church, which was called his <hi>Primer,</hi> ſo far and farther did this great Spirited Prince proceed towards Reformation, ſweeping away ſome of thoſe many <hi>Romiſh</hi> Rubbiſh and Corruptions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Religion was then Tainted with a fierce Beeſom of Deſtruction, which none durſt to have attempted or gone about (as the poſture of things then ſtood at home and abroad) but a Prince able to match the very Mother, and Mrs. of thoſe very Abominations in ſierceneſs, and haughtineſs of Spirit, of whom it is ſtoried, that he never ſpared Man in his Anger, nor Woman in his Luſt. And thus did God by fomenting an evil ſpirit between two ſuch fierce Enemies unto the truth, and purity of his Church, and worſhip turn the malice and miſchief of his Churches E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, unto his own Glory, and his Churches uſe, and advantage, and by his providence and diſpoſal, made uſe both of their Perſons and Purpoſes even againſt their own wills to his own moſt Righteous, and wonderful ends ſecretly, and mightily directed their wicked deſigns and Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Comfort of his Church, and choſen in the Accompliſhing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſhall ever be admired by all thoſe that Believe, that they who in ſucceeding Ages ſhall gather themſelves <hi>against</hi> Syon, <hi>and ſay, let her be defiled, and let our eyes ſee it may themſelves fear and tremble to be gathered as Sheaves into the Floor, and the Daughter of</hi> Syon <hi>to ariſe and thraſh them with Horns of Iron and Hoofs of Braſs.</hi>

Aſcends the Throne, Inheriting his Fathers Crown, but not his Vices, who? <hi>Joſiah</hi>-like, both in Minority and Piety took care in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabulis</hi> in the very Infancy of his Reign, that his Council ſhould conſult and uſe all their endeavours to make a more Goſpel-like and through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in which he did not <hi>patrizare</hi> (as his Siſter <hi>Queen Mary</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him) march furiouſly with Fire and Faggot, nor yet according to the advice that <hi>Calvin</hi> (who fond of his own <hi>Chymara,</hi> and Pettiſh at all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50679:81"/>that in Reformation would not tread in his Steps) gave to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, viz. <hi>to go on without fear or wit:</hi> but proceeded therein <hi>pacatè</hi> and <hi>conſultò</hi> well knowing that his Father by the rough handling of his Wives, of the Pope, and of other great Princes and Perſons, provoked and leſt many great and bitter Enemies to his Crown, and that more he ſhould raiſe againſt himſelf on the ſcore of his intended Reformation, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered withal that <hi>Dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet,</hi> that Alterations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and founded in Wiſdom, and proſecuted with care would continue firm and durable. Therefore he and his Grave ſages were not (as ſome of more puny dayes were) for the violent pulling up of root and branch, plant and build, who would, and who could, but they took all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration. As that tho Reformation ought to be, yet could not be without the Alteration of long received and Eſtabliſhed Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Rites and Ceremonies, ſuch as had been from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration an Impediment unto Piety, and true Goſpel Worſhip, and unto which the generality of the People were wedded, having been Trained up therein from their Cradles, that, as the change of all Laws, and more eſpecially of ſuch as related to Religion, ought very circumſpectly to be proceeded in; Laws as all other ſublunary things being ſubject to Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and many times grounded and made on Sandy and unſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and wrong Suggeſtions, that many times tho they be enacted as behooful, yet in Experiment and Practiſe prove very Inconvenient and dangerous if continued, that Experience daily finds juſt reaſon to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate many Laws tho of long ſtanding, and Laws that are expedient for one Age, not to be ſo for another; that ſometimes alteration of Laws tho from the worſe to the better (which was the caſe of our Reformers and Reformation) is many times attended with Inconveniences and thoſe very conſiderable; and therefore wiſe Legiſlators do not always chooſe nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nact that, nor all, which is moſt behooful, but that which is moſt behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and may be practiſed with leaſt diſturbance to the quiet State of the Church or Kingdom. <hi>David</hi> knew many things fit to be done in his Kingdom, yet for great reaſons of State would not do them himſelf, but when he lay on his Death Bed left them in Charge with his Son to do, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>thou art a wiſe Man,</hi> do <hi>thou according to thy wiſdom.</hi> 1 King. 2.6.9.</p>
               <p>Therefore our prudent and pious <hi>Joſiah</hi> did as early as he could aboliſh ſuch things as might be aboliſhed, and eſtabliſh others as might be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with leaſt diſturbance, and moſt approbation of the Peoples minds, and without danger, leaving other ſome to be cancelled and abrogated by himſelf, if God had lent him longer life, and ſit opportunities, or by his Succeſſors if God ſo pleaſed, or by diſuſage through tract of time. Did not Chriſt and his Apoſtles Steer the ſame moderate courſe, when they introduced Goſpel Worſhip, whilſt they diſpenſed for a ſeaſon with <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and</hi> other Ceremonies in the <hi>Proſelites of the Gate</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became abſolete meerly through tract of time and diſuſage. Did not Circumciſion continue in the Church for the Succeſſion of 15 Biſhops next Succeeding the Apoſtles, having been all Circumciſed? And might not our Reformers for the ſame reaſons juſtly retain ſuch Innocent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as they did, declaring as they did declare? might not <hi>Naaman the Syrian</hi> go Innocently into the Houſe of <hi>Rimon the Idol Temple,</hi> not to VVorſhip, but to do his Maſter ſervice, declaring publickly as he did? <hi>I know that there is no God in all the Earth but in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thy Servant from henceforth will offer neither burnt Offering nor Sacrifice unto other Gods, but only to the Lord.</hi> 2 King. 5.15.17.</p>

               <p>This moſt excellent Prince (tho he were the Son of a <hi>Boarnerges,</hi> yet fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he hated, ſire and faggot were none of his principles) after much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn deliberation choſe to Steer his Courſe in a mild and gentle way, and therefore firſt recalled thoſe that had abandoned the Kingdom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed the Impriſoned, becauſe they would not ſubmit to <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruptions, that they might enjoy that liberty of Conſcience, for which they had ſuffered extremities in his Fathers time, and that they might be ſerviceable to him in the furtherance of the work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and forthwith without ſtaying, for the return of the Baniſhed he ſmoothed the way to the intended work, by ſetting out ſome preparatory Injunctions, yet extant, which were ſent abroad into all parts of the Kingdom by certain Commiſſioners or Viſitors attended by Godly and Learned Preachers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to inſtruct the People, where they were to ſit and Act, the better to facilitate the work, that the people might not cool or relapſe, theſe Preachers were more particularly inſtructed, beſides the points contained in the ſaid Injunctions, to diſſwade the People from Praying to Saints, to the dead, from Adoring of Images, from the uſe of Beads, Aſhes and Proceſſions from Maſs, Dyrgies, Praying in unknown Languages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which was done to prepare the People, by little and little, that with the more eaſe and leſs oppoſition, they might inſenſibly admit the total in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Alteration in the Face of the Church. In the whole Progreſs they did deem it beſt to remove thoſe things firſt, which were leaſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and newlieſt crept in, and therefore did Abrogate a number of <hi>Sts. dayes,</hi> and recalled the <hi>Latine Services,</hi> and all <hi>Antiphoneys, Miſſals, Grailes, Proceſſionals, Manuals, Legends.

Articles of Religion and diſcipline Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, Churches cleanſed of things burthenſom to the People, offenſive and ſcandalous to the Simple, to which, God gave ſuch Bleſſings and Succeſs, that many Papiſts conſidering the reaſonableneſs and purity of the Worſhip, frequented our Churches and turn'd Proteſtants, others, tho <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> ſtill frequented our Churches, until the Pope made it <hi>a ſignum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctivum and then</hi> many <hi>return'd with the Dog to the Vomit, and with the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire,</hi> unto their old Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and Superſtitious fopperies again.

                     <hi>became a bone of contention from its</hi> very Cradle to this Nation and unto other parts of the World; many of the People and Miniſters ſeeming to be enlightned with a beam of truth, with an equal luſter and brightneſs, with that which ſhined in the minds of their Brethren, wholly decrying that prudential Complyance with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Ignorance and Adherence to Popery, and which Conſiderations he ſuppoſes ought to prevail with ſober men, to take the whole matter of the Impoſition of this, or the like form, once more under a Sedate Conſideration.</q>

               <p>§. It is true that our Reformers were but Men: that they never claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Infallibility, nor their work perfection, ſuch perfection as God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 35.8. <hi>a High way of Holyneſs throughout this Land, that Way-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, tho Fools, ſhould not err therein,</hi> yet ſuch perfection as the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe and Godly of thoſe times, and the poſture of Affairs then could deviſe and would admit of, we humbly conceive they had and ought ſo to be eſteemed. But is not he that Objects theſe, and were not thoſe great Luminaries he minds us of, Men, ſubject to like Paſſions and Infirmities with their Brethren? or is he, or were they any more Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe he Objects againſt? If not ſo, nor ſo, why ſo quarrelſom? why ſo Captious? O! to have the whole matter taken once more into a Sedate Conſideration. The requeſt I confeſs is modeſt and mannerly and not without Reverence, and it ſhall be conſidered with like reſpects.</p>
               <p>By this Diſcourſe of his, he ſeems to me to be of Opinion happily not erroneous, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no ſuch Contrariety between the different Opinions of the <hi>Aſſenters</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> in point of <hi>Liturgies</hi> and <hi>things indifferent,</hi> but that ſome moderation and connivance may be indulged to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> without peril of Inconvenience to the Government, and that without it, theſe petty differences and trifles may accidentally foment Diviſions and diſturb the quiet State of the Kingdom, and therefore the more prudent and ſafe way were to connive (at leaſt by a prudent Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality between the Contrarieties) and take care that none do Condemn the other, nor yet the preſent Government, but that all do live peacibly and Piouſly together.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of <hi>Luther</hi> many moderate <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes were of the ſame Opinion, and that many of the Modern <hi>Innovators</hi> Opinions might have been tollerated, if they had been modeſtly Maintained without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Doctrine of the Schools, which conſtrained <hi>Leo</hi> to retort againſt <hi>Luther</hi> thoſe Arrows which he had firſt Shot againſt the <hi>Apoſtolick See:</hi> But what more uſual in all Countries Ages and Times, than for <hi>Innovators</hi> by <hi>Petition,</hi> nay, by <hi>Protestation</hi> to ſhew willingneſs to refer themſelves and to ſubmit to a <hi>Sedate Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nay, even for Papiſts themſelves in their Differences and Diſputes (which are not few, as may be ſeen in <hi>Bellum Papale</hi>) to refer themſelves to the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet neither the one nor the other ought to be believed, that he or they have a purpoſe to acquieſce, if a neat and ſit occaſion be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to evade. Of this great truth the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, Janſenists,</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> indeed all Sects and Hereſies give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Teſtimony, nay, of this, <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf was a Manifeſt example, who (while he had to do only with the <hi>Fryers-Pardon-mongers</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> in matters of <hi>Indulgencies</hi> as alſo with the <hi>Doctors of Rome</hi>) did always ſay that he referred himſelf to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and when <hi>Leo</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50679:82"/>the promiſe for real, which was pretended only, <hi>Martin</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not keep it, but inveighed more againſt his <hi>Holyneſs,</hi> than he had done againſt the <hi>Pardon-Mongers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I appeal to our <hi>Author himſelf,</hi> was it ever found in any Story, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man or number of men were willing to have their Opinions Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? rather if their Opinions were rejected, they defended them more obſtinately, fortifying themſelves the more by reaſon of Oppoſition, by which means of many <hi>Sects,</hi> many <hi>Hereſies</hi> have ſprung.</p>
               <p>§. But to come more cloſely to his deſire, let us conſider and examine matter of Fact, how far this Diſcourſer and his Predeceſſors of the ſame perſwaſions have been gratified already in this way, and what effect it hath had, and how far it hath wrought upon them. Was not the firſt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, time, Compoſed by as Learned and as Pious Men, Men, known to all the world to have been famous in their Generation, for hazarding their Bodies to be burned in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> days, or if they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the Fire, were Baniſhed or impriſoned, and only becauſe they would not ſubmit to Popery and Superſtition, and upon as ſolemn deliberation as that Age could, or perhaps, as any Age ſince hath afforded: was not that <hi>Liturgy</hi> ratified by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſet forth <hi>March</hi> 17. 1549. and (to gratifie ſome that fancied themſelves <hi>to have a more pure Beam of light</hi>) was it not reviſed again in the ſame King's time, and re-eſtabliſhed? <hi>An.</hi> 5.6 <hi>Edward</hi> 6. And was it not taken again into moſt Solemn Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and before the <hi>Parliament</hi> would paſs their Vote for it, and put their Stamp unto it, was it not held requiſite that a Diſputation ſhould be held in <hi>Engliſh</hi> before them, for the better clearing of ſome points therein, as about Service in a Tongue unknown to the People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Power of the Church concerning Ceremonies, Eccleſiaſtical Rites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was it not held accordingly by 9 of each party, which began the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> each party one day delivering in Writing their Arguments, and the other the next day anſwering them in Writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
               <p>§. Did not <hi>King James</hi> in the very beginning of his Reign ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, as to comply with ſome of his more ſcrupulous Subjects, (who deeming themſelves alſo to have <hi>a more pure beam of light</hi> than <hi>Prelates</hi> or <hi>Conformists</hi>) Petitioned his Majeſty for ſome amendments of our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> on pretence of fitting it unto more encreaſe of Piety, as after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 40 <hi>years</hi> eſtabliſhment and quiet uſage thereof, to have it ſcanned and debated over again by a moſt Solemn conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> his Majeſty with others of his Council being preſent, and undoubtedly as well able to Judge as any that argued <hi>Pro or Con?</hi> whoſe admirable dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in diſcerning, whoſe Judgment and Learning in Affairs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of that Nature, gave ſuch ſatisfaction even to the Opponents themſelves, that they all ſeemed ſatisfied, and promiſed Conformity, and Obedience for the future, and <hi>Dr. Sparks</hi> one of the chief favourers of that Petition did write a Book to perſwade unto Conformity, at which Conference the Abetters of the Petition gave ſo little ſatisfaction unto his Majeſty, that he deemed all their exceptions to be no other than the Phantaſms of ſcrupulous Indiſcretion, and therefore concluded that if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 45 years injoyment of the clear light of the Goſpel, any did yet continue diſſatisfied, that ſuch diſſatisfaction did proceed rather out of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50679:83"/>ſtubbornneſs of Opinion than out of true tenderneſs of Conſcience. How far our <hi>Service Book</hi> was taken into ſedate Conſideration under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> of ever Bleſſed memory, and alſo of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> ſince his Reſtauration, and how little it hath wrought upon thoſe for whoſe ſake it was taken into Conſideration is ſo Notoriouſly known, and yet ſo freſh in our memories, that it is enough I have only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it. And is it not now ſetled <hi>de Novo</hi> and ratified by that Power that gives Life unto all our Laws, but yet if his deſires ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and indeed our <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhould be found to ſtand in need of ſome few and ſmall amendments, and ſhould be amended to the ſatisfaction of this Importunate Petitioner, yet if his Book be a juſt portraicture of his Opinion, he out-ſhoots <hi>Calvin</hi> one Bows length at leaſt, in that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>all ſtinted Formes of Prayers and Praiſes, to be Read and uſed by the Administrators of Goſpel Ordinances in their Adminiſtration of them</hi> (which <hi>Calvin</hi> was not) yet it makes nothing againſt a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> that may, or doth need none, and for ſuch it is as I plead: Beſides, <hi>Moſes</hi> did not think it an Impeachment of the gifts of the Miniſtry, nor yet of Ediſication, when he preſcribed a ſet form of Bleſſing the People, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23.27. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what ſecurity will or can this Petitioner give, that we ſhall from thenceforth have no more the like Impetuous and Importunate deſires from others, and that our <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhall then reſt unquarrelled at? Or what ſecurity can he give, if he ſhould be gratified in taking away the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> that the quiet State of the Kingdom ſhall not be diſturbed, or that Popery and Popiſh Worſhip in ſeveral Pariſhes, if not in all, ſhall not reenter?</p>
               <p>Beſides, all great Councils in matters tending to Innovation in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Government (eſpecially when Religion is concerned therein) ought in prudence to be back't by Arms, leaſt they prove deſtructive to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, which conſideration made <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. to put himſelf at the Head of an Army for the preſervation of his Perſon, of his Council, and even of the <hi>Reformation</hi> it ſelf, it was but prudence and high time ſo to do, and that early too, as the ſeveral Inſurrections did ſhortly after demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in which though Incloſures were pretended, and were in the Front and Face of them, yet returning to Idolatrous and Superſtitious Worſhip, was in the Heart and in the depth of their deſign.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is marvellous to conſider that <hi>after the Act</hi> for Repealing of all ſuch Statutes as any way ſeemed to touch the Subject in Life or Liberty for matter of Conſcience made in the times of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, againſt the <hi>Lollards,</hi> who differed in Opinion from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, as that Terrible Act of the 6 Articles made 31 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and thoſe other of a more mild Nature made 35 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9. for the qualification of the ſaid 6 Articles, and the Act prohibiting the Reading of the Bible in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made 34 <hi>Henry</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. were paſſed, and before the <hi>Liturgy</hi> was eſtabliſhed. All men ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch Repealing to have had a liberty of Reading Scripture, and of being their own Expoſitors of entertaining what opinions in Religion beſt pleaſed their fancies, and promulgating them <hi>(ſuch a Liberty is now ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly but inconſiderately pleaded for again.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what did this <hi>Liberty</hi> produce but Factions, Schiſms, and variety of Faſhions, and Modes in Celebrating the common Service and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments and other Rights and Ceremonies of the Church, nay, it is obſerved as intimated before in the <hi>Register of Petworth,</hi> that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50679:83"/>many at this time affirmed the moſt bleſſed Sacrament to be of little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that in many places it was irreverently uſed, and caſt out of the Church, and many other great enormities committed, nay, many of the Licenſed Preachers appear'd as Active againſt the Kings proceedings, as any of the unlicenſed Preachers had been found to be now what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can this our Author give to our Prince, that if the <hi>like Liberty</hi> ſhould now be Indulged to him and others that it ſhall not be abuſed, nor produce the like or worſe effects?</p>
               <p>All which together with the Inſurrections in <hi>Cornwall, Devon, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Suffolk,</hi> and other Counties ſpringing therefrom, the King and his Council ſeeing the dangerous conſequence thereof, concluded that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was the beſt remedy againſt Schiſme, Hereſie, Faction, and for the quiet State and Weal of the Kingdom, and therefore gave Order to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other Learned and Pious Men (rather than to uſe Severity againſt his Subjects) <hi>that a publick Liturgy</hi> ſhould be drawn and Confirmed by Parliament with ſeveral Penalties to be Infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on all thoſe, who ſhould not readily conform to the Rules and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of it, and accordingly it was ſo ſignified unto the Kingdom by Proclamation.</p>

               <p>And yet theſe were not all the miſchiefs theſe Indulgences did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.

When I Conſider through how difficult a Chapter,<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> through what Contrarieties of Opinions, what Contradictions of Men of different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Principles, Ends, and Intereſts, through how many Enemies, both Forreign and Domeſtick, and thoſe of the higheſt Potency <hi>this Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> did attain its accompliſhment; I cannot but wonder how any that ſeemed or thought themſelves to have <hi>a Beam of Light of equal Luſtre, &amp;c.</hi> Should yet to add unto the other difficulties <hi>Injicere ſcrupulum,</hi> caſt in their bones alſo of Contention by ſpeaking, or Writing in derogation of <hi>that Reformation,</hi> and <hi>that Liturgy</hi> (contrary to the very <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> made 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. under ſeveral penalties) which the Wiſdom and Zeal to Gods Truth and Glory of that Age was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to accompliſh, which could never have been brought to that perfection it was brought unto, had not God miraculouſly Bleſſed their endeavours, by giving them a juſt ballance, and a juſt weight of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations relating both to Church and State, and alſo of moderation. For the Parliament conveened in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1547. conſiſted of members diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing in Religion, tho probably they agreed to ſerve the preſent time, and preſerve themſelves, for tho many, both of the Nobility and Gentry, ſtood well affected to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet conſented to all ſuch Acts as were made againſt it, not improbably out of a fear of looſing ſuch Church-Lands and booty as they had got, in caſe, that Religion ſhould prevail and get up again, and for the reſt, who were either to make or improve their Fortunes, they happily did promote a <hi>Reformation</hi> for their particular ends and intereſts.</p>
               <p>§. That at the time of <hi>Reformation and framing of a Liturgy, others beſides the Reformers were enlightned with a Beam of Truth of an equal Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and Brightneſs, with that which ſhined in the minds of their Brethren,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:50679:87"/>I cannot gainſay, nor will deny: But by any thing that hath been yet Written, it doth not in the leaſt appear, that thoſe that then did, or ſince have made the <hi>Liturgy</hi> a bone of Contention, had a more clear beam of Truth in ſo diſparaging that bleſſed <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and therefore more ſhame for ſuch the Sons of the <hi>Church,</hi> to vilifie and ſet at nought the Conſtitution of their Mother, who Travailed ſo long with them, and brought them forth with great, ſo very great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite difficulties. <hi>Probroſa Ales quae Proprium nidum polluit.</hi> If the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of that Age then had, or this Author now hath <hi>a new Light,</hi> a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>clear Beam of Truth,</hi> it would certainly make evident, for the very nature of light is to make <hi>manifest.</hi> 5 <hi>Eph.</hi> 8.13. But ſeeing no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons demonſtrative, are brought to make good ſuch poſitions, is it not both prudence and duty in us, rather to rely on our own Judgments, being backt and reinforced with the Judgment of ſo many Learned, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Reformers, Liturgists,</hi> that gave Teſtimony thereunto with their blood, and of the Kings Privy Council, and alſo of his great Council of <hi>Parliament,</hi> both of thoſe times and of the ſucceeding Generations, all concurring in the Approbation and Impoſition of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> rather then to follow the Fancy and Opinion of one, or of a very few, either of that or the Succeeding Ages, that pretend indeed more light, but in truth have leſs, for ought that hitherto hath been Demonſtrated. But enough of this Subject, I ſhall only leave all thoſe of the <hi>Synagogue of the Libertines</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider, if ever ſuch <hi>Liberty</hi> as is deſired by all ſorts of men of different perſwaſions were ever given under any Chriſtian Government, and yet if it hath been given, if every Sect of them in their ſeveral alternate Courſes and turns, as they have happily got ſucceſſively the Power, and been uppermoſt, have not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their utmoſt, to depreſs and keep under all other Sects, differing from themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus premiſed and well weighed, I deem I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without the imputation of much Arrogancy, that Chriſt having Commanded <hi>Rem</hi> tho not <hi>formam Liturgiarum,</hi> the Subject matter, tho not the very Form and Words of our <hi>Liturgies,</hi> that tho neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles did ever Practiſe, or intimate any ſuch thing, nor yet the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> for ſome Centuries of years next after Chriſt, that they may ſtill be impoſed <hi>without the leaſt deſert of</hi> the Scandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being <hi>an unwarrantable Abridgment, or Infringement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, or of the Rules which Chriſt gave to his Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Regular Administration of his Word and Worſhip, or of any ſpiritual Abilities given or promiſed to be continued to them, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and performance of the whole Work of the Ministry,</hi> and will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the mind of Chriſt, and will much, very much conduce unto the main end propoſed, <hi>viz. Edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that they are but miſtaken Averments to affirm, <hi>that Liturgies or preſcribed or limited Forms of Prayer and Praiſes to be uſed or Read in the publick Administration of Evangelical Inſtitutions, cannot be made uſe of but by rejection of the Proviſion made by Christ. And that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them doth impoſe on others the obſervation of things in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which neither the Lord Jeſus nor his Apostles did appoint or impoſe. And that all ſuch Impoſition is deſtitute of any Plea or Pretence from Scripture or Antiquity, And that Liturgies are an Humane Invention contrary to the mind of Chriſt.</hi> I could now wiſh that this our Author
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50679:87"/>(ſeeing <hi>Liturgies</hi> do not pleaſe) would ſo far have obliged this whole <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as to have preſcribed us ſome better and more Adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate mean for the ſupplying of the defects of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and for the more eaſie and Familiar teaching and keeping our fundamentals pure and clean, and for the keeping out of Popery, Idolatry, Superſtition, and indeed, all kind of Traſh and Trumpery, that like a Torrent hath overſpread this Nation, ſince theſe dayes of Liberty, and decrying <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> from <hi>Ranters, Quakers, Adamites, Enthuſiaſts, Phanaticks, Seekers, Antitrinitarians, Antiſabatarians, Famuliſts</hi> and indeed from an <hi>Iliad</hi> more of others, <hi>ejuſdem farinae. <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

               <p>During theſe diſorders, <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt Dying, <hi>the 5th of Dec.</hi> 1560. and <hi>Charles the 9th,</hi> Aged 10 <hi>years,</hi> Succeeding; he more like the good Shepherd, than he that Styled himſelf <hi>Pius</hi> by the mature advice of his Council, after Solemn and great Conſultations and deliberations about the Troubles and Diſorders in Religion Ordained, that all that were in Priſon for Religion, ſhould be ſet at Liberty, their Proceſſes made void, their Offences pardoned, and their Goodsreſtored, and tho the <hi>Pope and Parliament</hi> did much regret and repine at theſe Liberties: yet in the year 1561. the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Edict,</hi> did Command, that no man under pretence of diſcovering the Congregations for Religion which were forbid, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with many or few into another Mans Houſe, that Priſoners for Religion ſhould be ſet at Liberty, and that thoſe that fled ſince the time of <hi>Francis the 1st,</hi> might return and repoſſeſs their Goods.</p>
               <p>§. And in the year, 1562. the <hi>Queen of Navar, Prince of Conde, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and the <hi>Dutcheſs of Ferrara,</hi> having long made requeſt, that <hi>Places</hi> ſhould be allowed to the <hi>Huguenots</hi> for their Sermons and Worſhip, which being mainly oppoſed by the <hi>Pope and his Papalins,</hi> Tumults did ariſe, as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50679:91"/>in other places, ſo more eſpecially in <hi>Dyon</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> moſt notorious, for the Death of many, for quieting whereof, the King and his Council called the Preſidents of all the Parliaments, to conſider of a remedy that might be ſit and Adaequate to the troubles of the whole Kingdom; theſe being all Aſſembled on the <hi>17th of January,</hi> it was reſolved, tho not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Oppoſition, that the <hi>Edict of July</hi> ſhould be in part remitted, and that the Proteſtants have leave to exerciſe their <hi>Religion, without, but not within the City,</hi> and that they ſhould not be moleſted in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Aſſemblies Congregated out of the City, nor hindred by the Magiſtrates, tho the Magiſtrates and Officers might be preſent at their Sermons and Meetings, if they pleaſed. Tho the <hi>Parliament</hi> could hardly be brought to accept of this <hi>Edict,</hi> yet it did take effect, and was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the <hi>6th of March,</hi> but with this Proviſo, that it was not to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the New Religion,</hi> but only by way of proviſion, until it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordained by the King, which was ſoon after, For the <hi>Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, full of all ſubtilty and all miſchief, like the Child of the Devil, did not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord,</hi> by whoſe <hi>Instigation</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> made a <hi>Sanguinary Decree in July</hi> following, <hi>viz. that it ſhould be lawful to ſlay all the</hi> Hugonots, <hi>which by publick order was to be Read every Sunday, in every Pariſh.</hi> Thus you ſee Indulgences have frequently been granted by the Papalins (that <hi>crudele genus</hi>) even unto <hi>Protestants</hi> (<hi>Hereticks</hi> in their eſteem) when the Peace of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and obedience of Subjects become queſtionable, <hi>non obſtante the Biſhop of Rome,</hi> who cannot think no Perſecution ſevere enough, that is leſs than fire and faggot, or what was formerly uſed againſt the <hi>Albigences,</hi> of whom <hi>Philippus Auguſtus</hi> put to Death 600 in one day, and againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> who were choaked in the Caves, whither they fled to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Herein I deſire to be fairly underſtood, that I do not by thus arguing Plead for Tolleration or Connivence, towards any Perſwaſion or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who either have no ſound Goſpel Principles of good Life and good Doctrine: or whoſe Principles and Doctrine are averſe and chag-reen to the Publick and Juſt Intereſts of States and Kingdoms, or whoſe Morals are like thoſe of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or who fail in fundamentals, but for thoſe on whom are obtruded or required more performances as neceſſary than ever God made neceſſary, whereby the Door into the Church, and the Gates of Heaven are by the Commands of Men made narrower than ever God made them. Opinions and Problems about things indifferent and not fundamental, nor yet abſolutely neceſſary, ought to keep their juſt Forms and Bounds, and not to be Impoſed as <hi>Oracles,</hi> which being of doubtful diſputation, and the truth of them not to be made evident by any infallible Power of Judicature, ought not to be brought into the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> or <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and therefore not to be obtruded, or Impoſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, becauſe they cannot be made clear Infallibly, and becauſe they have no Warrant from Scripture ſo to do. Some Doctrines are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary; others as clearly not neceſſary; let thoſe be urged as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, theſe only left to Men indifferently, becauſe indeterminate by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Both Governors and Governed are like Men, and ſubject to like Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Biaſſes: peeviſhneſs and Impatience of Contradiction, or Glory of Conqueſt may bear ſway in either, the beſt of Men, are but Men at the beſt. To be free from all Ignorance and error is the great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50679:92"/>of the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> when our Faith ſhall be turned into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and our dark knowledge into clear Comprehenſion; and therefore to expect an abſolute and general aſſent in all particles of truth, is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Vanity, and to exact it, a greater Tyranny of pernitious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heretofore Wiſe <hi>Princes</hi> (unleſs ſome times over born by the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able importunities of proud and haughty <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi>) indulged Tolleration unto diſſenting Brethren, whoſe opinions did not diſturb the Publick Peace and Intereſt of Nations. And theſe latter Ages have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us an undeniable Argument from the good ſucceſs thereof, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this great reaſon, that prudent Indulgence doth not diſturb, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure publick Peace, becauſe by ſo doing, there is not ſo much as the pretence of Religion left to make quarrels withal, becauſe it is indulged unto them; ſee the fruits of it in our neighbour Nations, whilſt <hi>France</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> it did but ſpill her own blood, exhauſt her own Treaſure, weaken her own ſtrength, and could do no great things abroad; but becoming wiſer, how powerful at home, how formidable abroad, both by Sea and Land, I need not tell, but the moſt remarkable inſtance is to be collected from the different ſucceſs of the different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Margaret of Parma,</hi> in the Government of the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Duke de Alva,</hi> when ſhe by her moderation and Clemency, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quencht the great fire and flame therein kindled, He, her Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in that Government, managed it with that fury, that it proved too hot, both for him, his <hi>Prince,</hi> and his <hi>Religion</hi> to abide it.

               <p>§. Some others, not <hi>Papalins,</hi> nor yet <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> are much againſt any Connivence, and not altogether without ſome ſhew of reaſon: As, that to give Diſſenters ſatisfaction in ſome requeſts, will but give them encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and pretence to prepare more, and to think they are their due; and that it is eaſier and more ſecure to deny their demands, than being once gratified, tho but in part to preſcribe them a meaſure, or a <hi>Non <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> and that the granting their deſires, tho but modeſt, will give the party encouragement to believe that they were deſervedly deſired, nay, perhaps that they were enforced, which opinion alone, tho not true, but believed to be ſo, might endanger the quiet State of the <hi>Church,</hi> or at leaſt might be a great abetting to their party and obſtinacy, and keep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>Aſſenting and Conſenting,</hi> which, ſay ſome amongſt us, ought not to be impoſed, affirming full Aſſent and Conſent in reſpect of Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be due, not to the Scriptures themſelves, but as they are expreſſed in their firſt Original Tongues, which opinion, if true, yet is it no juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with us, for that full <hi>Aſſent and Conſent is not required by the Ast of Parliament,</hi> eſtabliſhing our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> to <hi>the veracity of every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, but only to the uſe of it in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. On the contrary, in Ballance to theſe, it is averred that it is a Rule in Chriſtian Actions, <hi>that as evil is not to be done, that good may follow,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50679:92"/>ſo no <hi>good of obligation</hi> is to be omitted or forbidden, for fear that evil may enſue. And that the great Wiſdom of Experience, both of Elder and more puny dayes hath ſufficiently taught Poſterity, that it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moſt neceſſary for the quiet and welfare both of Church and State, to yield to the infirmities, and ſcrupulous imperfections of others, and to apply and accommodate themſelves to that remedy, which, tho in rigor is not due, yet in prudence and equity is convenient, and may with good Conſcience be tollerated; for all Laws ought to be fitted to times and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they alter and change: moſt aſſuredly the uſing of ſome remiſſion in yielding unto the deſires of the People, in matters which are <hi>de jure poſitivo,</hi> or <hi>Pontiſicio</hi> of humane ſanction, only may conduce to the quiet State of the <hi>Church,</hi> but cannot diſturb it: what elſe is the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Brigade of things <hi>Adiaphorous,</hi> wherein <hi>truth may be on either ſide without being diſſimular to her ſelf? If no liberty allowed, what availeth the blotting out the hand Writing of ordinances, and the Nailing of it to the Croſs?</hi> 2 Col. 14.20. <hi>to what end is the purchaſe of Chriſtian Liberty, St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſo often boasts of? his Doctrine is, that he that eats all things or eateth Herbs only, or he that esteems one day above another, or he that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems every day alike, may do either to the Lord,</hi> and Eat, or not Eat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or not regard a day, Conform, or not Conform, uſe, or not uſe Liturgies, all may be done to the Lord; and why ſhould we then judge one another, in the uſe or diſuſe of any of theſe? <hi>the Kingdom of God is not Meat, nor Drink,</hi> nor Lawn Sleeves, nor Surplice, nor Capes, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but <hi>Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy, in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 14. Rom. How many things of an indifferent nature might be tollerated in peace, and left to Conſcience only, were it not for <hi>great thoughts of heart,</hi> or for teſty Spirits? and had we inſtead thereof but pure Love, and Charity; and were it not for ſome ſecret Hypocriſie that prompts to be ever judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, ſaying, <hi>stand by thy ſelf, come not near me, for I am Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer than thou?</hi> 65 Iſay. 5. contrary to the Apoſtolical precept, 14 of Rom. 13. <hi>let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no Man put a ſlumbling Block, or an occaſion to fall in his Brothers way, to impoſe</hi> more things as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> than <hi>ever God made</hi> or <hi>impoſed as neceſſary,</hi> and that under ſeverities, what is it leſs than to create ſtumbling Blocks, or contrive occaſions for our Brethren to ſtumble and fall by? It cannot be expected, that all Man, and things in a Church ſhould be Gold and Silver, and Precious Stones, there will be ſome Wood, ſome Hay, ſome Stubble, Wheat and Tares, good and bad; humane Ordinances muſt grow till the Harveſt; it is the Angels Miniſtery, not ours, that muſt ſever them.</p>
               <p>I intend not here that Superſtitions, Idolatry, or Popery ſhould be tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated or countenanced, which as it ſelf extirpates all <hi>pure Religion,</hi> and undefiled, and all <hi>civil Supremacies</hi> to boot, ſo it ſelf ought utterly to be deſtroyed, Root, and Branch, yet not by Fire and Faggot, not by Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes, and curſed Inquiſitions, but by wholſome Laws and diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other mild means: that likewiſe which is abſolutely evil, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith or manners, as <hi>Popery</hi> is, no Law can poſſibly Tollerate, that intends not to unlaw it ſelf; but thoſe bordering indifferent things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſome point of Doctrine not fundamental, or of Diſcipline, which tho they may be many, yet may be held without the violation or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the <hi>unity of the Spirit, or of the bond of Peace,</hi> and may be permitted. I appeal to their reſpective Judgments, who they think in the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50679:93"/>day of their Account will rather be juſtified, they that are inſtrumental to Impoſe or Command things that may be ſpared in the Worſhip of God; or they that <hi>Conſcientiouſly,</hi> tho <hi>Erroneouſly</hi> cannot ſubmit unto the uſe of ſuch things, tho in their own and true nature but indifferent: Who made the <hi>Schiſme</hi> between <hi>Rome</hi> and us, <hi>Rome</hi> impoſing, or we refuſing?</p>
               <p>§. The Counſel tho but of a <hi>poor Woman of Abel,</hi> being ſollowed, ſaved the City, and may not I, tho the leaſt in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus impartially, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> Diſſenters, now alſo intreat, that Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren in point of <hi>Liturgies</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> impoſed, that ſeeing <hi>Atheiſm, Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>ſquinting toward Rome,</hi> and the countenancing of ſin and ſinners is ſo much feared by them, that they would be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed how they forſake their Mother in this her neceſſity, and not ſo wholly indulge, and pleaſe themſelves in their own fancies and opinions, and thereby adventure, rather to Sacrifice <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> War, and Ruine, than forſake their Humors. I counſel no Man to do ought, no not in things in different, with a doubting Conſcience. Fearful are the Examples of ſuch as are unreſolved, yield to Practice. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, give me leave with a Worthy and Reverend Divine, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound as a matter not unworthy their Conſideration and Deliberation, whether this ſhould not be a Miniſters reſolution, <hi>viz. To lay down his Ministery for nothing, for which alſo, he ought not to lay down his Life?</hi> and whether with Comfort may Miniſters, eſpecially after their allowing of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> at the time of their <hi>Ordination,</hi> and by their ſeveral Subſcriptions, and otherwiſe having thus put their hands to the Plough, look back, and leave their Calling, rather than uſe the Liturgy, and enjoyned Ceremonies in our Church, teaching as ſhe doth, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing Gods pure Worſhip, deteſting all <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and urging Ceremonies, Innocent Ceremonies, not for Ornament, much leſs for neceſſity of Gods Service, but for decency, order and policy only, and as means to teſtifie Subſcription to the Lawful Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate:</p>
               <p>I appeal to your ſelves, do you in good earneſt think that Paul (who <hi>accounted himſelf a fool for Christs ſake, became weak, deſpiſed, endured Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirſt, Nakedneſs, Buffeting, Fighting with Beasts at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his own hands, being defamed, and made the ſilth of the World, and the Off-ſcowring of all things, who made himſelf Servant unto all, unto the</hi> Jews <hi>a</hi> Jew: <hi>to them that are under the Law, as under the Law: to them that are without Law as without Law: to the weak as weak, who became all things to all Men, that he might by all means ſave ſome,</hi> and <hi>all this for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells ſake,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>c.</hi> 9.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>And that he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced that Christ was Preached in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, tho out of envy and ſtrife, tho not ſincerely, tho but in pretence not in truth</hi>) would ever have ſcrupled to have uſed the Ceremonies, the Innocent Ceremonies of our <hi>Church,</hi> or that he would have ſilenced himſelf, or looked back, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than have Preached in a <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Hood:</hi> in <hi>Lawn Sleeves</hi> or <hi>Surplice:</hi> in <hi>Cowl,</hi> or <hi>Miter,</hi> or indeed in any habit tho unbeſeeming? It were vain ſo to imagine. It is rather to be preſumed that he would as in 1 <hi>of Phil.</hi> 18. have anſwered, <hi>what then? notwithſtanding every way, whether in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or in truth Christ is Preached, and I therein do rejoyce, yea and will rejoyce.</hi> Is it then reaſonably to be Imagined, that he that <hi>gloried that Chriſt was Preached every way, tho out of envy and strife,</hi> tho <hi>not ſincerely,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:50679:93"/>would not have rejoyced to have him Preached in a Linnen decency or any habit, yea, tho happily not well beſeeming.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide it were not imprudent, nor yet below, nor <hi>Priest</hi> nor <hi>Prelate</hi> to conſider whether <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo complacent to all tempers and all ſtrengths, and infirmities (as it is manifeſt that he was) and all to gain Souls, would ever have promoted or contributed the leaſt towards the <hi>impoſing of things not neceſſary on his Brethren or fellow Labourers?</hi> I trow not! ſeeing not only he, but the Council met at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> together with the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> then and there aſſiſting them (and greater aſſiſtance none on Earth can pretend unto) having already declared; that to impoſe things not neceſſary is burthenſom. <hi>For it ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater Burthen than things neceſsary,</hi> 15 of <hi>Acts</hi> 28. and therefore would not do it, and his Precept is, <hi>what you have ſeen in me, that do, Phil.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Take therefore the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrine for your Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and conſider well your charge and Indelible Character, the neceſſity laid upon you, that have put your hands to the Plough, by having had hands laid on you, and the Wo denounced againſt you, if you look back, and ſilence your ſelves by your <hi>non-conformity</hi> unto <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ſo Innocent. Conſider alſo that your Conſciences can have no place here, for that it is out of the Ken of Mortals to diſcover, whether real or pretended only, and therefore cannot be the leaſt duſt in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to weigh any thing againſt the ſolemn and weighty Charge and neceſſity laid upon you, and the Wo denounced againſt the non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of your duty, nor yet to weigh any thing againſt the peace and quiet of <hi>Church and State</hi> when ever they come in Competition, and are involved in ſuch diſputes; what if all or any of our enjoyned Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Habits or Liturgy are needleſs, ſinful, they can never be proved? what if the Worſhip be as pure without them? nay, what if the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſinful which can never be proved neither? what do all or any of theſe concern you? the Impoſers, not you, muſt account for that to their and your Maſter, and muſt ſtand or fall according as they have done well or ill therein. It is not to be doubted, but that ſome Commands may be ſinful and <hi>yet the performance of ſuch Commands not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However moſt aſſuredly <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> do not depend on things <hi>indifferent:</hi> but the peace or diſturbance of a Commonwealth may, for the diverſity of opinions in ſuch things do more affect <hi>publick peace,</hi> than <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Faith ſalviſical.</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> have Conſciences, and an account to give of them, as well as their Subjects, and it is their greateſt wiſdom, nay, a duty incumbent upon them, as to conſider the Intereſts of their Dominions, ſo more eſpecially to conſider the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> in the propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in the increaſe of Godlineſs the greateſt intereſts of all States and Kingdoms of the World, maugre the black mouths of all Atheiſts to the contrary.

               <p>I Appeal to your ſelves, is it reaſonable that any Generation of Men, whether <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Protestants, Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Phanaticks, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> indeed any kind of Men of any perſwaſion whatſoever, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conſcience (unto which all mankind without poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuted, may pretend and lay claim as well as they) ſhould <hi>lege jam constituta,</hi> be tollerated to diſobey it? Were not this to take away the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50679:94"/>obliging part of the Law, and in good earneſt to make it null and void, and to make the Law to obey the Men, and not the Men the Law, and in the concluſion to deſtroy all Government, and to bring all to Anarchy and confuſion?</p>
               <p>§. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> were not all of one mind concerning the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Interim,</hi> and therefore ſome of them about the year 1548. did in part yield to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> alleadging for their Juſtification, that the things done by them were indifferent, and by conſequence that they did not concern their Salvation to reprove or allow, to receive or reject them, and that it was Lawful, nay, neceſſary to ſuffer ſome ſervitude, ſome infringements of Liberty, when no impiety was joyned with it, and therefore in theſe the Emperor was to be obeyed, which practiſe I hope our Diſſenters will on better thoughts think ſit to follow, eſpecially conſidering, that in the cauſe of Religion every ſubdiviſion gives many advantages, and much ſtrength to our common adverſary the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it being much more advantagious to the whole Body of the Church, that the Members thereof, tho infirm, and crazy, ſhould be ſtill continued members, than that they ſhould be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejected, or cut off from the Body by any Interdict, or Cenſure of thoſe that bear Rule over them, or by any frivolous ſcruples or frowardneſs of their own: even Members whilſt crazy may contribute ſome ſtrength ſome advantage to the whole Body: but when diſmembred they can add no ſtrength to the whole, but may diminiſh and trouble the quiet State of the whole; beſides cutting off, and rejecting often cauſeth deſpair, and makes deſperate, but if they be ſtill carryed in the Boſom of the <hi>Church,</hi> and like Lambs in the Arms hereof, ſuch gentle means may reclaim them without giving any trouble to the peace of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> what if the Abatement of ſome rigors do thwart the deſigns and intereſt of ſome, that never think they have Domination enough? muſt there not therefore be a ſlacking of ſome ſeverities, when for want thereof, the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> is thereby endangered? Indeed, <hi>Pope Adrian the 6th,</hi> in his Letter, dated 25 <hi>of Nov.</hi> 1552. to the <hi>Dyet</hi> at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> by his <hi>Nuntio</hi> adviſed ſar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in the cauſe of <hi>Luther,</hi> exhorting them to proceed unto ſharp and fiery Remedies, to cut the dead Members from the Body, as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently was done to <hi>Dathan and Abiram,</hi> to <hi>Ananias and Saphira,</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian and Vigilantius,</hi> and as their Predeceſſors did to <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom of Praghe</hi> in the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> whoſe example in his eſteem they ought to follow: He Wrote Letters alſo almoſt to all the Princes of the ſame purport and tenour, terming <hi>Martin a Phanatick</hi> or <hi>Frantick Man.</hi> The ſame Council did his <hi>Nuntio</hi> moſt vehemently reinforce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by 7 mighty reaſons (as he thought) mentioned in his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But when he endeavoured to give them ſatisfaction as to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Centum gravamina,</hi> of the ſcandals, and grievances of the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> Preached againſt by <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by <hi>all the Empire,</hi> He was then of another mind, and then forſooth, the Diſeaſe being inveterate and multiplyed, it was neceſſary to proceed ſlowly in the Cure, and to begin from things of greater weight to avoid confounding of all, by deſiring to do all together, and the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> only was to reform them, and they were to reſt content with promiſes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that <hi>Centum gravamina</hi> were but gently to be touched, not to be rooted out, no need of quick and ſharp Remedies for the extirpating of them, but the <hi>Dyel</hi> well obſerving that the <hi>Nuntio took wrong meaſures of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50679:94"/>good and evil,</hi> only as they had relation to the <hi>Profit, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and not to the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the <hi>advancement</hi> of <hi>true Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and deeming that the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the peace of <hi>Church and State</hi> ought rather to incite, to do the good that is eaſie to be executed, than to ſupport the evil that is hard to be indured, they reſuſed to uſe ſuch <hi>Keen Remedies,</hi> and that for moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and urgent reaſons.</p>
               <p>§. The plain and demonſtrative truth and medium is, that as whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> for real advance and propagation of the Goſpel, or for the Eſtabliſhing, or well Governing, of the <hi>Church of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> ought ſtrictly to be aſſerted: ſo about things indifferent, or that are of a middle nature between ſit, and neceſſary, and not abſolutely ſo, there ought to be no Strife, no Contention, no Cruſadoes, no Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no unreaſonable ſeverities uſed, conſidering, that <hi>Non-Aſſenters</hi> are Heirs of the ſame Common Salvation, and who otherwiſe do agree in the Fundamentals of the ſame Common Faith in one Kingdom, there being no Reaſons that the Conſciences of Men ſound in Doctrine, and Holy in Life and Converſation, and willing to Conform, tho not to every petit Ceremony, yet without any ſcandalous difference, ſhould be Rackt and Enſnar'd by <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> unto things doubtful, not abſolutely good, nor yet abſolutely neceſſary, and without which, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> would be <hi>as pure,</hi> and the <hi>Polity</hi> as <hi>Excellent</hi> as now it is. Impoſition of ſuch ſeverities for ſuch things where <hi>Epiſcopal Government bears Sway,</hi> ſeems to me to diſparage and debaſe even that moſt Excellent Regiment it ſelf, as if that could not Subſiſt or Flouriſh, except the Mouths of ſome other Learned and Painful Labourers and Husband-men in Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard be Sealed up by Wiles and Snares. Certainly, <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> ſtands not upon ſuch <hi>Lame Crutches,</hi> as that the abatement of ſome few Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors in things at beſt but Indifferent, ſhould endanger thereby the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thereof, it needs not, Certainly, it needs no ſuch Artifices, for its Eſtabliſhment, it being no more for the Support and Honour of <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> to have Men Preaching the ſincere Word of Truth, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accordingly to be ſilenced, and accounted their Oppoſites: Than it is to have ſome Conformiſts to aſſert it with their Tongues and with their Pens, and yet be a reproach to it, by being Dumb, by their Non-reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by their Lives and Converſations: or that it is for others to Drink, Swear, and Prophane, to avoid the Name and Cenſure of being Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Presbyterian, and that they may be reputed Prelatical: But be it a great ſin in the Governors and Fathers of our <hi>Church,</hi> to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to ſtop the Mouths, and hinder the uſe of Goſpel Talents in many of the Inferior Paſtors upon ſlight and ſlender occaſions, yet it is a greater Crime for ſuch Inferior Paſtors to deprive themſelves and their Flocks, of the ſame Goſpel Priviledges, upon the ſame or like niceties, for that they ought to be more unwilling to ſeparate themſelves from the Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> to which they are called by ſtopping their own Mouths, than to be cut off from the Commonwealth wherein they live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is impoſſible but that Offences must come,</hi> 17 <hi>of Luk.</hi> 1.18 <hi>of Mat.</hi> 7. and therefore it is impoſſible, that all viſible Miniſterial Churches, or the Polity of them ſhould be pure, and uncorrupt, or that all ſhould be <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore ſome unworthineſs in Members, and ſome Corruptions in Officers, and ſome Offices in the Church, tho not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50679:95"/>neceſſary, may with good Conſcience be born withal, and that ſome Errors at leaſt in the Diſcipline and External Rites may be tollerated, ſeeing, there may be the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> tho <hi>Prophaned.</hi> A Holy City without a Wall: A Field of the Lord, tho the Enemy Sow Tares. Look back and Conſider, that the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> was ſtained with almoſt all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities of a higher Nature, both for Manners, and Faith, and yet unto the ſame, all <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> whatſoever without difference were <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by King Joſiah,</hi> and others, when the People of God <hi>Worſhipped the Calf in the Wilderneſs,</hi> when they <hi>Adored the Brazen Serpent;</hi> when they <hi>ſerved the Gods of Nations;</hi> when they <hi>Bowed themſelves to Baal;</hi> when they <hi>Burnt Incenſe and Sacrificed unto Idols;</hi> and for which, Gods Wrath was Kindled againſt them, and the Prophets juſtly Condemned them, yet there was pure Corn, tho mingled with Tares. A <hi>Church</hi> of ſome ſound, tho mingled with ſome unſound Members, which will be unto the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt untill the end of the World, till the Angells the Reapers come and gather the Tares to be Burned with unquencheable Fire. Therefore all Parties and Men of different perſwaſions ought ſeriouſly to Conſider, that the beſt Men, are but Men at the beſt, alike Subject to Paſſions, and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilties, to have their Affections miſperſwaded, and their Judgments miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, ſome to have knowledge without Zeal; others to have Zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, that the greateſt Clerks are not always the Wiſeſt men: and therefore that both they that have, and they that have not the truth or beſt Pollity on their ſide in Differences and Diſputes of this Nature, which concern chiefly, if not meerly Polity, and Regulations, Rites and Ceremonies ought to be ſo Charitable one towards another, as to believe that they all holding faſt (as they all do) the main Principles and Doctrines of the Goſpel; that they err only by miſconſtruction, and that each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Errors are not concerning Fundamentals, but Diſcipline only, and thoſe alſo <hi>purae negationis,</hi> and not <hi>pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> and therefore may live peacibly and holily here, under either Government, and may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meet in the preſence of God, and <hi>ſee his Face</hi> with Comfort, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould ſubmit to other.</p>
               <p>§. Conſider again, that thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> which were Founded and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Apoſtles themſelves, and where they Preached and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were not exempt from <hi>Imperfections</hi> perhaps as great, if not greater than thoſe now in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whereof the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> gives a clear Teſtimony, but more clearly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4, 5. As to their Charity, they are Taxed that <hi>ſome of them adhered to</hi> Paul, <hi>ſome to</hi> Cephas, <hi>others to</hi> Apollos, <hi>with a Schiſm, and expreſs Renting of the Seamleſs Coat of Christ.</hi> And as for Opinions and Doctrines, there were ſome that <hi>denyed the Reſurrection.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. As for Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>they drew their Pleadings and Differences before the Tribunals of Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. As for manners, they had <hi>Fornication among them, and ſuch as was not ſo much as named amongst the Gentiles.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. As for Cuſtoms, the Supper of the Lord was converted into Banquets where ſome were <hi>Drunk, and others Hungry,</hi> nay, there were Hereſies and Schiſms among them alſo. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this while the Apoſtle acknowledgeth them to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> and a <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> and did not ſilence himſelf, but continued labouring by his Preachments, Faſtings, and Prayers to amend them, and yet he lived under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Averſe even to Chriſtianity it ſelf. How ought we then to ſtand
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50679:95"/>faſt, and comply, and diſpence with ſome irregularities in the <hi>Church,</hi> where God by his ſingular Grace hath ſetled us, altho in the Government thereof there have been, and ſtill are Imperfections and Abuſes, which are alſo by tract of time converted into marvellous grievances. For reaſon of State and of good Government its good to be obſervant of all eſtabliſhed San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and tho many Novelties of Reformations do ariſe, yet to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves with readineſs unto them, howbeit we do not much approve of them, becauſe things of Cuſtom have their Remedies, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations are never without their miſchiefs, againſt which it is very hard to find a Remedy.</p>
               <p>§. Edification in the Indiſputable truths of Faith, and in the Indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duties of Life, being the main end and Objects of <hi>Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> its Honour enough for <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Gods Commandements only, there being no neceſſity of enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than what the Apoſtles did in plain and perſpicuous terms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of obſcure Allegorical and Metaphorical Expreſſions for Exorbitant Powers, for <hi>Excommunication, Cenſures,</hi> and God knows what? Yet, Be it as ſome Diſſenters would have it, that all Men profeſſing the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> have an undoubted Right and Priviledge to Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Aſſociate together to Pray, Preach, and Perform Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without Aſſenting, or Conſenting, nay, contrary to the Approbation and Commands of the Civil Magiſtrate, nay, and that by a Paramount Power, derived even from Chriſt himſelf, and all this, not without the Warrant of this Demonſtration, that except it had been, and were ſtill ſo, the Goſpel could never have been Preached to all Nations, then mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies to Chriſt and his Goſpel, nor could yet be Preached, where the unknown God is only Worſhipped. Be it ſo, as in truth it is ſo, that the Preachers of the Word of Salvation, and the Adminiſtrators of the Sacraments, being things Commanded them by God, ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by men, and are ſo far exempt from Humane Law, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of them is of no Force, or Virtue, it being in ſuch Caſes <hi>better to obey God than Men.</hi> 5 <hi>Act.</hi> 22. and for that no Mans right ought to be denyed him either in things Civil, or Spiritual, for fear they ſhould abuſe it, for that then no mans right ſhall be preſerved ſafe unto him. Be it ſo I ſay, even as they would have it, yet as ſurely and as undoubtedly the <hi>Caeſars</hi> have their Patent, their Charter and Charge, from the ſame <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount Power,</hi> for the Countenancing and Propagating the Goſpel, and ſuperviſing the Profeſſors thereof, and they have a <hi>Paſtorſhip</hi> to give an Account of, as well as thoſe of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and therefore they ought to be as ſcrupulouſly careful, and as Zealouſly watchful as themſelves: Was it not Propheſied of <hi>David</hi> a <hi>King.</hi> 34 Ezek. 23. <hi>I will ſet up one Shepherd over them, and he ſhall Feed them, even my Servant</hi> David, <hi>he ſhall Feed them, and he ſhall be their Shepherd, and I the Lord will be their God, and my Servant</hi> David <hi>a Prince among them. v.</hi> 24. and was he not <hi>taken</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly from the <hi>Sheepfold, to Feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his People, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and he Fed them according to the Integrity of his Heart, and guided them by the Skilfulneſs of his Hands.</hi> 78 Pſal. 70.71, 72.</p>
               <p>Beſides, were this Objection of greater Force than in truth it is, yet, it hath no place in this Kingdom, for that ſuch <hi>Liberty</hi> of Aſſembling, is not only not denyed, but permitted, Countenanced, nay, Commanded, and Churches ſeparated for that very end and purpoſe only, that what
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50679:96"/>Talents, what Light ſoever the Complainants may have, they may not hide them under a Buſhel, or in a Conventicle, but may manifeſt them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to all Commers: But if under this their great Goſpel Priviledge, and under the Shelter of indiſcreet Niceties they will meet in Private, and thereby give a jealous State great Cauſe, only to ſuſpect that they do it, that thereby they may the more opportunely Foſter and Foment a Party Averſe to preſent Eſtabliſhed Conſtitutions of <hi>Church and State,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath as undoubted a Goſpel Power and right to Prevent, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, and puniſh Tranſgreſſors. If their Doctrine be ſound and good, why ſhould they not have Churches? if not, why ſhould they be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Corners? Look but a little back, and conſider if the late times have not given too great cauſe of fears and jealouſies to a Wiſe and Chriſtian State, to uſe all juſt endeavours to prevent the like for the Future, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo what moved our fore-fathers to make ſevere and Sanguinary Laws againſt Papiſts, was it not becauſe they were troublers of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> working like Moles under Ground, endeavouring the <hi>Ruin</hi> of our <hi>Church and State?</hi> If ſome may be ſuffered, tho but by Connivence to break thro ſmall Laws, both themſelves and others will thereby be encouraged to ſet the greater at nought.</p>
               <p>Herein I deſire to be rightly underſtood, not, as if I Pleaded for a general Tolleration, nothing leſs! I abhor the thoughts of it, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter, there being a Vaſt difference between ſuch a Tolleration of Idolatry, Superſtition (crying ſins, and therefore abſolutely unlawful) and a Remiſſion only of ſome <hi>few ſeverities</hi> in ſome <hi>Acts, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Injunctions</hi> which relate only to Formalities, that tho in conſtruction of Law may be exacted, yet may be diſpenſed withal, without prejudice to ſound Doctrine or good Converſation, and without which the <hi>Worſhip of God would be as pure and ſincere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, all Acts, Canons, and Injunctions, whether they relate unto Uniformity or not, ought according to their own Nature to be ſincere and free from all Traps and Covert deſigns to exclude any that Profeſs the ſame Faith and Worſhip, tho many cannot perhaps, thro meer tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, ſubmit to every thing therein enjoyned. In Concerns of this Nature, <hi>Scripture</hi> in a more eſpecial manner ought to be <hi>the Rule of Reſolutions,</hi> and that abſtractly and purely, without mixing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them Intereſt, Uſurpation, or Artifices of men, elſe what were it but by Edicts to <hi>lay Snares in</hi> Miſpah, <hi>and ſpread Nets upon</hi> Tabor, to uſe Laws, Menaces, and ſubtleties to keep Gods People from his Court and Sanctuary, and Confine them to State-Religion, and to Walk after the Mode of the Commands of men?</p>
               <p>Thoſe Non-conformiſts, Non-aſſenters, that have received Order (which they could not have had but <hi>permiſſu ſuperiorum,</hi> by the Licence, and under the Authority of the <hi>King</hi> in our Laws expreſſed, <hi>For no Man hath Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give himſelf either Orders to be a Prieſt, or Inſtitution to a Paſtoral Charge, but must depend upon another Power,</hi> who by Acts, Canons, and Edicts long ſince publiſhed and extant, hath directed the qualifications of the Perſons to be Ordained; the manner and Form how; the Perſons, who ought to Ordain them, &amp;c. and they could not be ignorant that the <hi>Liturgy and enjoyned Ceremonies</hi> were by the <hi>Imperative Constitutive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church and State,</hi> to be Countenanced and uſed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches by the <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Pastors;</hi> either they conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Conſciences when they entered on the Miniſtery by taking Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50679:96"/>Orders, whether they could Comply and Submit unto the whole Frame of Government and Polity of this <hi>Church, Constituted by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> from whom they were to receive Authority and Licence to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Function, Gifts, and Talents, or they did not, If they did not, they are inexcuſable for entring on ſo Sacred a Calling, Stamped with an Indelible Character ſo raſhly, ſo unadviſedly, without perſpect or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of Conſequences, and yet if they were ſo pur-blind, as not to ſee one ſtep before them, yet their neglect herein cannot be Pleaded in their Excuſe, it being their own Fault; in Common Juſtice, no Court will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any man to take Advantage of his own miſdemeanors or failings: Beſides, hath not every Miniſter that hath receiv'd Paſtoral Charge, twice or thrice, if not oftner witneſſed his allowance of all and ſingular the 39 <hi>Articles of our Church,</hi> once at his Ordination before the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> then at his Inſtitution into his Benefice before his Ordinary, and both theſe by Subſcription under his own hand, and afterwards upon his Induction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Flock, and that by verbal Approbation, he hath not only acknowledged in the Church, <q>the Power of Ordaining Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. 20 <hi>Articles.</hi> But he hath after a ſort bound himſelf openly to rebuke ſuch as willingly and purpoſely break the Traditions and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Church, as Offenders of the Common Order of the Church, and Wounders of the Conſciences of the weak Brethren and hurters of the Authority of the Magiſtrate, <hi>Artic.</hi> 34. and is it not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. that they ſhall be puniſhed (<hi>pro ut</hi> in the Act) that ſhall Preach, declare, or ſpeak any thing in derogation or depraving our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Are not then ſuch Diſſenters obliged both in Conſcience, and by virtue of their own Voluntary Acts and Subſcriptions, to be conſtant to their own Hands and Tongues, if they would be accounted <hi>Faithful in Gods Houſe as was Moſes:</hi> And is it reaſonable then to hearken unto ſuch, Pleading againſt their own Voluntary Acts and Subſcriptions, their own Hands and Tongues? Beſides, <hi>quo jure</hi> with what Face or Conſcience can they expect Temples, maintenance, protection, and all things requiſite for their Miniſtery, from that Law and Government that they will not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, Countenance, nor ſubmit unto?</p>
               <p>§ Indeed, it ſeems to me an old piece of Conſcientiouſneſs, if not Impiety, to enter the Holy Miniſterial Function to day when they are ſure without Conformity to be ſilenced to morrow; Beſides, it is Nicety and Indiſcretion to exact an <hi>expreſs Rule of Scripture or Faith, for the Croſs in Baptiſm, for ſtanding at the Creed, Kneeling at the Lords Beard, for Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in Divine Service,</hi> the uſual ſear-Crows of ſcrupulous men. In theſe caſes conſent of the Church or Tradition, may ſuffice, ſo there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law of Command to the contrary. He that exacts in theſe Points as expreſs Rules of Faith, or Warrant of Scripture for his Obedience to Eccleſiaſtical Government as he would, or as every man ought to do, for adventuring upon Worſhipping of Images, Invocation of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth make his Brain or Fancy the chief Seat of his Religion, which ſhould be ſeated in the Heart, and Intitles God to the Fancies and Chymaeraes of their own Brains.</p>
               <p>Thus to diſobey the Church in theſe Caſes, wherein it hath Authority to Command Obedience, is to diſobey thoſe Mandates of God, which give the <hi>Body of the Church</hi> Authority to make Laws to <hi>Govern it ſelf</hi> by in things indifferent, neither expreſly Forbidden, nor expreſly Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

This laſt Maxim is undoubtedly true, and the former Precept moſt exactly to be obſerved in ſuch Cauſes as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, that is, where the poſitive Practiſe (unleſs our Warrant be Authentick in it ſelf, and evident to us) is very dangerous or deadly; whereas on the contrary, the forbearance of ſuch Practiſe, is either ſafe or not prejudicial to our Souls, but to our Bodies only, or State temporal, ſuch Ceremonies as be neither againſt Faith, nor adverſe to good manners, in the Judgment of St. <hi>Austin, ep.</hi> 11.8. go for indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and may be Born in Chriſtian Unity without Offence or Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Yet did Chriſt cure the blind, raiſed the dead, cauſed the dead Stones of the Temple to rend in ſunder, and put blackneſs on the face of the Sun at mid-day.

Though all the wiſeſt and moſt ſober men of the World, have ever taught that Kingdoms, Cities, Companies, cannot long continue, nor proſper, where Religion and Piety are ſlighted or neglected: yet there are ſome, and thoſe no ſmall Fools, (though great Wits in their own eſteem) who have ſo little of the fear of God before their eyes, that they think that Princes are ſo much the more firm, and eſtabliſhed in their Thrones, by how much more ignorant and wicked their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are, and Religion vilified, and ſet at naught, becauſe, ſay they, they are thereby more proper, and as it were born to Servitude, and the Yoak. <hi>Patientiores ſervitutis quos non decet niſi eſſe ſervos,</hi> Plin.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50679:100"/>and contrarily the beſt men are the moſt obedient, fearing others more than they are to be feared themſelves. And therefore that great Prince <hi>Augustus</hi> had wont to ſay, that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> did <hi>Deiſie Princes.</hi> The Piety of a Soverain, conſiſteth in his care for the maintenance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Religion, as the Propagator and Protector thereof. This conduceth unto his own honour and Preſervation, for they that truly fear God, dare not attempt, nor think of any thing, either againſt their Prince, who is the Image of God upon Earth, or againſt the State: Nothing but Religion can maintain humane Society; without it all manner of wickedneſs, and Savage Cruelties would abound; Religion only doth bridle, and keep in Order Common-weals. The State of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf, did increaſe and flouriſh more by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> than by all other means, wherefore it ought to be the Princes chiefeſt care, that <hi>Religion</hi> be preſerved in its purity, according to the juſt Laws and Ceremonies of the ſame: He muſt likewiſe endeavor to hinder Innovations and Controverſies therein: For that change in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a wrong done thereunto, draweth along with it a change and declination in the Common-wealth, as <hi>Mecenas</hi> well diſcourſeth to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Dion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> of all Weapons is moſt potent, overcometh all affections, and charity it ſelf, and is the ſureſt bond of Humane Society: Kingdoms are more bounded, and more divided by Religion, than by any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines and Boundaries whatſoever. He that is bigot in his Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth Wife, Children, Kindred, nay his own Life; if there be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Religion in the ſame Family, the <hi>Father is against the Son, and the Son against the Father.

               <p>As it is not to be tollerated, that every one ſhould ſhape out his own Religion, and bring in new Rites at his pleaſure, and conſequently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the publick peace, ſo it is moſt neceſſary that every one, both Kings, Prieſts and People ſhould amend themſelves, becauſe a good life is a moſt vehement Orator to perſwade. And Magiſtrates are more bound than private men to fear God, <hi>[He that ruleth over men, must be just ruling in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.3. <hi>and it is an Abomination to Kings to commit Wickedneſs, for the Throne is Eſtabliſhed by Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pet. 16.12.14.] to be zealous of Holy Faith, that they diſcharge Chriſt his place, in whoſe ſtead they are. And they are alſo more bound to avoid Hypocriſie and Superſtition, to maintain their Power and State in the exerciſe of Religion, to take great heed that that does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to their People, which ſometime fell out to the Jews through <hi>Moſes</hi> long abſence, who thinking that in him they were deprived of the true God, they made them one of Gold. A thing which if it were well conſidered, the World would not be at that paſs which now it is at. He that ruleth with the beſt Arts of peace, uſeth this as a chief inſtrument to cauſe the people to believe this as a firm truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prince is ordained by God for the good of his people, and ruleth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50679:101"/>with approbation of Divine Authority, and the Subject conſequently is obliged to obey him in all his lawful commands. Princes of all others have moſt reaſon to juſtifie and advance Religion, as having no other right or title (conſent excepted) to Govern by, that is Obligatory. If they diſclaim that, Adieu to all other rights and pretentions. For that over any one ſingle perſon, and much leſs over a multitude, (and ſuch is every Politick Society in the World) no one man, nor yet any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men have compleat lawful Authority to be Lord or Judge (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government excepted, which even nature it ſelf hath Eſtabliſhed from the very Creation of man, all men having ever been taken as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lords and Kings in their own Houſes all the World over) but by conſent of men, or by immediate appointment of God, unto whom all the World is ſubject, <hi>Hook. Eccl. Pol.</hi> f. 70.</p>
               <p>As all Princes and Civil Magiſtrates, whether of Kingdoms or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicks, have two callings, the one of Chriſtian the other of Governors: ſo in both of them they are obliged by the ſtricteſt Bonds of Divine Precepts, to ſerve God both as Chriſtians in obſerving the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in general, as every other private perſon with all their hearts, minds, and ſouls; and as Princes alſo with well ordering of Laws, and exemplarily encouraging and exhorting their Subjects to Piety, Honeſty, and Juſtice, puniſhing all ſuch as tranſgreſs Gods Commandements, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Decalogue. This Power God hath given to Princes, not peculiarly for their own uſe only, ſo that they may not ſuffer it to be impaired without ſin, for that it proceedeth from God, and is given by him for the good and benefit of the Governed, and therefore they ought to be marvellous careful, not to ſuffer it in the leaſt to be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or Impeached by <hi>Pope,</hi> or any other Eccleſiaſtick, who for many Centuries, under a ſhew of Zeal, have <hi>quo jure quave injuriû</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make way for their Ambition, and to uſurp, and monopolize that power to themſelves, which of indubitable Right belongeth to the civil Magiſtrate, leaſt it thereby become inſufficient for good and intire Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thereby both Prince and People ſuffer Injury, and God be offended. For if Princes be not bound to the governed, yet to God it is a debt and duty which cannot be fully and truly paid, but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his publick Authority intire, and by no means ſuffering it to be impeached or diminiſhed, which Power is not Arbitrary, ſo as to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to fancy <hi>(quod libet licet)</hi> and ſo one mans will may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cauſe of all mens miſery, ſuch an apprehenſion might cauſe even a Saint to be miſled, and to walk beſides his rule, which is the word of God, <hi>by me Kings Raign, and Princes decree Juſtice, Prov.</hi> 8.15.</p>
               <p>It is unknown to few, how Eccleſiaſticks for ſome hundreds of years by-paſt, have with all their might laboured to Uſurp Temporal Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Princes, and how great progreſs they have made in it, tho not without great diſturbances of the Civil Governments wherein they have endeavored it, and which the revolution of many Ages hath not as yet wholly recovered, and for want of which whole Nations fare the worſe unto this very day. And of latter years <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> ſet forth a Book, wherein he is ſo bold, as to labour to make Princes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Cauſes Temporal,</hi> and moſt impudently dares to treat them all as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which ſay, that the Prince in Temporal Affairs, hath no Superior but God only, thereby preferring the Ambitious ends
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50679:101"/>of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> before the Publick ends of Gods Holy Truth, and of his Vice-gerents. He pretends therein to write againſt <hi>Barclay,</hi> but his main drift and deſign is to advance the <hi>Popes Power</hi> to the <hi>Zenith</hi> and top of omnipotency it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In this Book he treats of nothing, but of the <hi>Popes Power over Princes,</hi> wherein it is more than five and twenty times inculcated, <hi>viz.

               <p>This Book was written by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> preſently after the <hi>Murther of</hi> Henry <hi>the Great of</hi> France, before whoſe death ſuch Doctrines were but whiſpered and covertly broached, but ſoon after his death, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited them out moſt impudently, leading Princes then as it were in Triumph, as that they might be <hi>Excommunicated by the Pope,</hi> deprived of their Kingdoms for unskilful Governing, weakneſs of ſtrength, or any other cauſe or ineptitude that His Holineſs ſhall deem juſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Book</hi> was ſo offenſive to ſome of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves, not only becauſe of thoſe falſe Doctrines ſo broached, but becauſe he aſſerted <hi>thoſe Doctrines to be the Doctrines and Faith of the Catholick Church,</hi> and pronounceth all thoſe that did think otherwiſe to be <hi>teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious and ſcandalous Hereticks, Paraſites of Princes, Ethnicks and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicans.</hi> Notwithſtanding all theſe bold Averments, the wiſe <hi>State of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> fore-ſeeing the evil conſequences of ſuch Doctrines, might follow to the diſturbance of the Peace of a Nation, they preſently forbid the coming in of that Book into their Dominions, leſt their Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhould be ſeduced into the ſame errors: Whoever ſhall wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Murder perpetrated by <hi>Ravillac,</hi> 1610. throw the Inſtigation of the Jeſuits, and the Decree of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> clearing themſelves, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the guilt thereof, and of all Aſſaſſinating Doctrines and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, on the Jeſuits, and ſhall alſo conſider <hi>Anti-cotton</hi>'s Refutation of Father <hi>Cotton</hi> (a Jeſuit and Confeſſor to the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who had highly oblidged him and the Society, by giving them his Houſe at <hi>La Fleſche</hi> for a Colledge with 1000 Crowns yearly Penſion for Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and had otherwiſe marvellouſly obliged them by many favors, thereby hoping <hi>to ſecure his Life,</hi> but all in vain) his <hi>Declaratory Letter to the Queen,</hi> and ſhall alſo conſider the <hi>Diſcourſe to the Lords of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> touching the ſaid Murther, all manifeſtly proving the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to be the <hi>Plotters</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> in that horrible Murther, all printed ſoon after that deteſtable ſtroak, <hi>viz.</hi> 1610. and ſhall alſo conſider that the ſaid Book of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> was the very ſame year Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> under the <hi>Popes Noſe,</hi> with an <hi>Imprimatur by Fr.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50679:102"/>ſilence, and to be content and very well pleaſed, and that there was a right underſtanding between him and the Jeſuits. About this time alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> 1610. as if Hell-hounds had been breaking looſe, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were ſo inſolent, fierce and zealous, to make His Holineſs <hi>Almighty</hi> on Earth, that there being in <hi>Rome</hi> a very great number, above 150 <hi>Catchpoles, Serjeants</hi> or <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> whom they perceiving to be men of diſſolute lives, of profligated honeſty, and living very little like Chriſtians <hi>(the fitter for their turns)</hi> they deſigned to erect in their <hi>Church, a Society of them only,</hi> pretending to teach them Chriſtian Doctrine, and to exerciſe them in <hi>frequent Confeſſions,</hi> which the <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſuſpecting ſo ſtrict a Practice of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with ſuch their Miniſters, they complained with the <hi>Pontiff.</hi> Wherefore the Biſhop of — who had advanced them 30000 Crowns in order thereunto, being near to death, and died ſoon after, then the <hi>Apoſtolick Chamber</hi> not approving the <hi>Donation,</hi> took the Money as a <hi>Booty,</hi> and applied it as they thought fit.</p>

The Covetous deſire of inlarging Phylacteries, Wealth, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, doth ſo naturally blind men, even Eccleſiaſticks, that without any reſpect to plainneſs and ſincerity of Gods own Holy Writ, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to Cavils only, pittiful Blaſphemous Cavils, Averring, that if God doth puniſh, and hath puniſhed Sinners; the Pope, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors his delegates may, and ought alſo to puniſh them.

               <p>Nothing more frequent and ordinary, than for Judges whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Powers are limited by Paramount Authority, to ſeek the enlargement thereof, tho by the diſabling of the General Juriſdiction, as well Civil as Eccleſiaſtick: And this proceedeth as well from the natural Inclination, which all men have to command in chief, as alſo from the profit and Grandeur, which neceſſarily attends Soveraignty. But if ſuch Eccleſiaſticks or others do ſeek enlargement of their Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Commiſſion and natural duty, the Supream Civil Magiſtrate is moſt to blame if he ſuffer it, tho ſometimes with good intent and ſucceſs, for that it can never be with Wiſdom.

               <p>The old and true Legitimate <hi>Romanists,</hi> for the firſt 300 years and more (whoſe Faith and Doctrine the Proteſtants at this day both own and defend) were altogether unacquainted with the Doctrines of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical greatneſs, Liberties (or Licence rather) Immunities and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that are now claimed by the now degenerate, and <hi>Bastardized Romanists,</hi> who tho of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet are not true <hi>Romaniſts</hi> indeed, who
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50679:102"/>under a Spiritual pretence, but with a ſecret ambitious end, and deſire of Worldly Wealth and Domination, would free themſelves from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due unto the Prince; and by falſe inſinuations take away the love, and reverence due by the people unto their Prince, and cement it unto themſelves. And to bring theſe things to paſs, they have lately invented a Doctrine of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy,</hi> and have erected an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> whoſe main concern and deſign is, to maintain the <hi>Popes Power</hi> to be above that of <hi>Kings,</hi> which Doctrine was unheard of till the dayes of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> I. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, 1073. neither is there any Book found concerning it, till about the year 1300. then did they begin to write of it ſcatteringly,<note place="margin">Vide Gold aſtum</note> but there were not above two Books which treated of nothing elſe but this, until about the year 1400. and three until the year 1500. after this the number encreaſed a little, but it was tolerable. But after the year 1560. this Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to encreaſe in ſuch manner, that they gave over writing of other Doctrines, and little was printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but Books <hi>in diminution of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Authority,</hi> and exaltation of the <hi>Eccleſiastical.</hi> The Confeſſors like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe need no other learning to be approved of, whence is univerſally ſpread a perverſe opinion, that <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are <hi>humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> yea, and Tyrannical, that they ought only by compulſion to be obeyed, that the diſobeying of Laws, and defrauding the Publick Revenues is no ſin: and he that doth not pay, if he can but fly from it, remains not guilty before God. And contrarywiſe, that every <hi>beck of Eccleſiaſtical perſons</hi> without any other thought ought to be taken for a Divine Precept, and binds the conſcience: And this Doctrine above all others, is the chiefeſt cauſe of moſt or of all the Inconveniencies, which have happened in theſe latter Ages: In <hi>Italy</hi> Books that defend the Princes Temporal Authority, and affirm that Eccleſiaſtical Perſons are alſo ſubject to publick Conſtitutions, and puniſhable if they violate the publick tranquillity, theſe are condemned Books, and ſuppreſſed more than any others. They have gelded the Books of Antient Authors by new Printing of them, and taken out all which argue or plead for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Aurhority, ſo that if in Authors we find no good Doctrine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Temporal Authority, we know who hath taken it away. If we find any that exalteth the Eccleſiaſtical, we know, who hath put it in, and in truth we can be aſſured of the truth of no Book that hath been under their cenſures. And it is alſo moſt evident, that thoſe who deſire to have an unqueſtionable liberty to brand the lawful Temporal Power, and that Doctrine which oppoſeth it ſelf to their attempts, with the name of Tyranny, do deſign that under pretence of Religion, they may become Arbitrators of all Government.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> giving Spiritual Authority, had given alſo indirectly the Temporal, which was a vain ſhift, ſeeing they made no other difference than of words. But the greater part of theſe men ſpake plainly, that the <hi>Pope hath all Authority in Heaven and Earth,</hi> both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal, over all Princes of the World,</hi> no otherwiſe than over <hi>his Subjects and Vaſſals:</hi> that he might correct them for any fault whatſoever: that he is a <hi>Temporal Monarch over all the Earth:</hi> that from any Temporal Soveraign Prince, men <hi>might appeal</hi> to the <hi>Pope:</hi> that he might give Laws to all Princes, and annul thoſe, which were made by them: for the exemption of Eccleſiaſticks they all with one voice denied, that they held it by the Grace and Priviledges of Princes, altho their Laws to that purpoſe, Conſtitutions and Priviledges, be yet extant; but they were not agreed how they had received it, ſome of them affirming that it was <hi>de Jure Divino;</hi> others that it came by conſtitutions of Popes and Councils. But all conſented upon this, that they are not ſubject to the Prince, <hi>no not in caſe of Treaſon,</hi> and that they are not bound to obey the Laws, unleſs it were <hi>vi directivâ.</hi> And ſome paſſed ſo far as to ſay, that the Eccleſiaſticks ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the Laws and Commands of the Prince be juſt, and whether the People be obliged to obey them, and that they owe not unto the Prince, either contributions, cuſtoms, or obedience: that the Pope cannot erre or fail, becauſe he hath the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore that it is neceſſary to obey his Commandments, <hi>whether they be just or unjust:</hi> That to him appertains the clearing of all difficulties, ſo as it is not lawful for any to depart from his reſolution, nor to make reply, <hi>tho the reſolution be unjuſt:</hi> That tho all the World differ in opinion from the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet it is meet nevertheleſs to yield to him, and he is not excuſed from ſin, who follows not his advice, <hi>tho all the World judge it to be falſe.</hi> Their Books were full alſo of ſuch other Maxims, that the <hi>Pope is a God upon Earth,</hi> a <hi>Son of Justice,</hi> a light of Religion; that the <hi>Judgment of God and the Pope, is one and the ſame thing,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and the Court of the Pope and God: That to doubt of the Power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> is as much as to doubt of the Power of <hi>God.</hi> And it is notable, what Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath boldly Written, that to reſtrain the Obedience due unto the Pope unto things concerning the Salvation of the Soul, is to bring it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: That St. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was not his <hi>Judge,</hi> and not to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> leſt the By-ſtanders ſhould have laughed at him:</q> That the <hi>Holy Biſhops of Old,</hi> ſhewed themſelves ſubject to <hi>Emperors,</hi> becauſe the times ſo required, others adjoyned farther, that then it was meet to introduce the <hi>Empire of the Pope</hi> by little and little, it being a thing unſeaſonable to deſpoil <hi>Princes</hi> newly converted of their Eſtates, and alſo to permit ſomething unto them for to intereſs them.

To contradict which, there was publiſhed a Treatiſe of <hi>John Gerſon</hi> written 150 years before, to which was adjoyned a Letter, exhorting all Curates to take care of their Churches, not fearing the Offence of God by not obſerving the Interdict.

               <p>In the dayes of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> (that Great Prince) there lived in <hi>Italy</hi> that famous <hi>Alchymist,</hi> and Impoſtor Nick-named <hi>Mamugna,</hi> who was verily believed that he could make Gold, not by the <hi>Vulgar</hi> only, but by <hi>Cardinals, Princes,</hi> nay by the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf.

               <p>But in truth all the <hi>Papalins</hi> were not of the ſame mind and opinions with thoſe famous <hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> the <hi>Popes Partiſans,</hi> nor with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but Books were Printed <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> by <hi>Papalins</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great numbers. For beſides the <hi>Papalins</hi> within the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> were very Orthodox, and maintained the Defence of the lawful Secular Power, oppoſing themſelves againſt the Uſurpations of <hi>Rome,</hi> and maintaining the Liberty of the <hi>Gallican Church,</hi> for that <hi>Kingdom</hi> holds it for a matter moſt certain and apparent, <hi>that Popes have no power over Princes, and that they ought not to proceed by Cenſures againſt them, or their Officers in things which concern the State.</hi> And as ſoon as the <hi>King</hi> knew of the publication of the <hi>Monitory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> he complained greatly of the too haſty proceedings of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſent a diſpatch to him with ſpeed, requeſting him to accommodate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Polonia</hi> abſolutely denyed the publiſhing of the <hi>Popes Monitory,</hi> for that it did not ſtand with reaſon to govern themſelves after another faſhion towards that <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Cauſe was common with his own Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf divided, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this their greateſt point, and <hi>Diana (Juriſdiction)</hi> both from the old and from the more <hi>Novel Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as from that of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And thus you may perceive the unquiet and uncertain State that all Princes are like to be in, and their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never like to be better whilſt ſuch monſtrous State-deſtroying-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are held for Goſpel at <hi>Rome.</hi> For it matters not whether theſe Doctrines are true or falſe, or received and believed by others or no, nor yet whether Proteſtants or Papiſts, it is all a caſe, ſo long as ſo believed at <hi>Rome.</hi> You ſee the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> a Popiſh Republick, no more ſafe nor quiet, than <hi>England</hi> a Proteſtant Kingdom. Had the Popes Swords been keen and powerful enough, no doubt, but that they would have brought both thoſe States in their reſpective differences and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, as once <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> the Emperor, to that Brute <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, creeping on their knees, to obtain Abſolution from their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Excommunication, or as <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, whom <hi>Hildebrand</hi> would not releaſe from his <hi>Excommunication,</hi> till he came bare-foot to <hi>Canuſium</hi> in a bitter cold Winter, waiting three dayes before the Popes Palace for his Abſolution, which he hardly obtained by the Interceſſion of the Dutcheſs <hi>Matilda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> beſides that, he is the Head of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, is alſo a <hi>Prince,</hi> who hath for more than 600 years by paſt, aſpired to the Monarchy of all <hi>Italy</hi> at leaſt, (I might ſay at an univerſal Monarchy Temporal and Spiritual) which he hath been ſome time ſo near to obtain, that it is a wonder that he hath miſled of it, ſeeing he leaves no ſtone unturned, <hi>quacunque arte,</hi> to enlarge his Juriſdiction. He hath three great charges upon him, 1. That of Religion. 2. That of Eccleſiaſtical affairs. 3. The Temporalty of his Eſtate: The care of all which I ſhall not grudge him, as of right belonging unto him in one or other of his Capacities, ſo he kept within his own Dominions and Territories, tho happily all of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion will not allow him ſo much, for that all <hi>Biſhops</hi> ought to be governed by the <hi>Canons,</hi> and (in which both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>all Biſhops</hi> antiently, in the beſt and pureſt dayes did acknowledge the Supream power to be,) to which they all ſubmitted, and not by the Pope alone, there being alſo three kinds of <hi>Canons.</hi> 1. Of Spiritual things. 2. Of Temporal things. 3. Of thoſe that are mixt of both, the Care of the firſt belongs to the <hi>Pope</hi> within his own Territories, and to the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Order obſerving the Canons. With the Second he hath nothing to do out of his own Dominions, <hi>quatenus</hi> a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And <hi>Princes</hi> ought to take as much care of the third, as <hi>Church-men,</hi> if not more. And thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> are too unworthy, ignorant, and mean, that will ſuffer themſelves to be excluded or uſurped upon. And if the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe all his power to make men believe that Princes ought to be excluded, why then do they which have the advantage of many clear Texts of Scripture, of the Judgments of Councils and Fathers, together with the practice of all times, ſuffer themſelves to be ſo abuſed? If they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and would maintain in them the power which God and the people hath given them, they would quickly put off the Mask, and make thoſe bluſh that deſign ſo to abuſe the goodneſs and ſimplicity of others, and would vindicate themſelves from the conſtant injuries which are offered them, and not ſuffer themſelves to be led by the Noſe as they are, as if they had offended Religion, by defending the power which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50679:107"/>God had granted unto them, and the Juriſdiction whereof a Prince ought not to ſuffer the leaſt diminution, but rather put a Flook into their Noſtrils, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth did.</p>
               <p>Certainly, not only for truth and conſcience ſake, but even for neceſſity and reaſon of good Government every Faithful Man, but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Princes,</hi> ought carefully to defend and to make the preſervation of Religion their chiefeſt concern and buſineſs. For this end God hath appointed <hi>Princes</hi> as his Lieutenants, and conferred Greatneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon them, to make them <hi>Protectors, Defenders, Conſervators,</hi> and <hi>Nurſing</hi> Fathers of his <hi>Church,</hi> in which calling, the greateſt of them can never give a good account to God, neither can it anſwer the ends of Government they are intruſted withall by God and Man, except it be by a continual and Vigilant care in matters of Religion. And how be it there be many abuſes, yet that is not to be imputed to the fault of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (which is in it ſelf true,<note place="margin">James 1.4</note> pure and Holy) <hi>but unto them that abuſe it.</hi> Perfection and abſolute purity, endeavoring to be perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting nothing, is the very end whereunto the <hi>Church,</hi> and every Individual thereof, ought to pretend and aſpire unto, tho it be not the path wherein they alwayes tread.</p>
               <p>Tho divers Times do require divers Laws and Orders, and tho <hi>Popes</hi> for the more excellent Government, ſhould make more reaſonable Laws than other Princes (which is not reaſonable to believe) and ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be received (which he ought not to do) yet as in the World, nothing can be held unchangeable, and every cuſtom ought to be accommodated to the time and perſons, ſo it is to be done by them only, whom in reaſon and of juſt right it concerns to do it, and by no others, <hi>viz.</hi> by the lawful, and <hi>natural Prince,</hi> by the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his people and not by the <hi>Pope.</hi> If any one not lawfully called thereunto, could rule common buſineſs of himſelf, which tho he did do with good intent, and happy Iſſue, yet did he nevertheleſs tranſgreſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane Laws. For to give juſt force unto a Law, it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be convenient and reaſonable, for that it is eſſential that it be made by thoſe who have full power to make them, and this not only for the preſervation of Power and Juriſdiction, but alſo for the neceſſity of a good Government.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange piece of Jeſuitical non-ſenſical Polity, to hearken unto them when they tell us, that Laws in all Kingdoms may be without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, becauſe they are of force, and in uſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet things are there in a quiet and peaceable condition, the State of <hi>Rome</hi> being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of other Princes: For that the <hi>Romans</hi> moſt impudently and againſt all reaſon affirm, that <hi>they are above theſe Ordinances,</hi> if they think ſit they may or may not obſerve them or diſpence with them, and they do wonderfully ſerve for their ends, as well when they are obſerved, as when they are diſobeyed, <hi>becauſe they are not to be ruled by the Laws, but they do rule, and govern the Laws.</hi> In other Kingdoms, when the Laws are once publiſhed and received, they are no more in the Princes power, they muſt then run to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeek a Remedy, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not what is behooful to another State, but to their own, and what will ſerve their own Turn and Ends beſt. Their great Deſign being to monopolize under colour of Religion, the Adminiſtration of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things, without which States cannot be governed, by which means <hi>Rome</hi> would become Miſtreſs of the World, and judge of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50679:108"/>propoſing that if there be any Inconvenience, they ſhould have recourſe to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and he will redreſs. But the <hi>Remedy</hi> which comes not from the <hi>ſame Prince,</hi> but from them who have their <hi>proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Interests</hi> is worſer than the diſeaſe. God whoſe works are perfect, and who is the Author of all Principalities and Order, gives to every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as much power as is neceſſary to Govern it ſelf well: neither will he have it acknowledged from any other but from his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. All that which Kings acknowledge from others, but from God and their own Subjects is meer Slavery and Subjection, whether in Civil or Eccleſiaſtick concerns.</p>
               <p>§. As it is deſtructive to <hi>Kings</hi> to acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi> to have the leaſt power in the making of their Laws, ſo it is no leſs deſtructive to allow him any priviledge to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> them, it being nothing leſs than to confeſs a want of Wiſdom or of Authority to ordain them, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is to cut the very ſinews of Government, which muſt needs be haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded, if they grant him but a power, by his Cenſures, to conſtrain them but unto a <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> a thing deadly pernitious to the liberty of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes, who muſt neceſſarily reſt deprived of all Soveraignty, when they ſubmit themſelves unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſhall have power by his Excommunications, or Interdicts, to force them to <hi>regulate</hi> or <hi>ſuſpend</hi> their Laws and Ordinances after his Will, and pretence of Eccleſiaſtical lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And to give Popes never ſo little in things of this nature, is but to make them more Inſolent, and to give them encouragement to demand and ſtuggle for more, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſions to conceive pretenſions above all Princes, for what <hi>power</hi> ſoever they now enjoy, <hi>beyond Preaching</hi> and <hi>Administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> they have had from the largeſs and good graces of good and Pious Emperors, tho now ſo grateful as to ſcorn to acknowledge them, but to claim them by the moſt <hi>potent claim</hi> in the World, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and to fight againſt the Sons and Succeſſors, with the very Weapons which their Fore-Fathers and Predeceſſors had put into their hands. In ſum, the Popiſh claim of ſuch enormous, and exorbitant Juriſdiction over all Kings and Biſhops, hath certainly been the grand cauſe of all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, troubles and wars in all Countries of theſe latter Ages.

               <p>In thoſe dayes never any <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pretended ſo much as to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Benefice</hi> within the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>another Biſhop,</hi> nor had the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as yet <hi>introduced the Cuſtom of drawing Moneys from others</hi> by way of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſations.</hi> But immediately after the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> began to challenge a <hi>Freedom,</hi> from being <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>Canons,</hi> and that at their pleaſure they might change all Antient Conſtitutions of the Fathers, Councels, yea, and of the Apoſtles themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored in the room of the <hi>Antient Primacy</hi> of the <hi>See Apostolick,</hi> to introduce an abſolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> not bounded or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by any <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> the Diviſion ſoon ſprang up, and tho 700 years paſt, Peace and Re-union have been divers times attempted, yet could it never be effected, becauſe diſputes have ever been intended, and promoted more than the <hi>taking away of that abuſe which was the true Cauſe</hi> that brought Diviſions in, and made the Rupture, and is the only Cauſe that ſtill maintains them. Whilſt the Churches were united, the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was held by both <hi>Churches,</hi> and obſerved, that in affairs of publick Government, all men ought to pay ſubjection to the <hi>Prince,</hi> becauſe God commands it ſhould be ſo, whom he doth diſobey, who will not yield obedience to the ſecular power by him appointed for the Government of all Mankind, never did any pretend that he might not be puniſhed for miſdeeds, holding it for certain, that <hi>exemption to do evil, is a thing condemned both by God and Man,</hi> the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe dayes were held for good and ſound Doctrine, <hi>viz. wilt thou not be afraid of the Temporal Power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe for the ſame, but if thou doſt evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath upon him that doth evil, Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. After the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of thoſe Churches, the ſame opinion ſtill remained in the <hi>East,</hi> and continues to this day. The truth of theſe things being ſo undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, methinks that it would not be unbeſeeming him, who accounts himſelf the <hi>Father of all Chriſtendom,</hi> to put off the <hi>Mask</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and abandon all his <hi>pretentions unto unlimited Powers,</hi> which would in good earneſt be for the good of all Chriſtendom, conſidering he hath but one Soul, and that he ought to do any thing to ſave it, and nothing to deſtroy it, and that it is not made of any better or other mould or mettal, than the Souls of his Brethren, in both Capacities of <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and that Heaven and Hell muſt divide the whole World, and therefore he ſhould wave his own private ſublunary Intereſts for the <hi>univerſal good of all Christendom.</hi> If ſuch conſiderations move not, yet methinks they ſhould conſider, that the World is now grown wiſer, and have made a full diſcovery of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of all his <hi>Excommunications, Cenſures,</hi> of his <hi>Bulls, Interdicts, &amp;c.</hi> nay they themſelves have made them all <hi>Ridiculous</hi> in many particulars, witneſs themſelves at <hi>Rome,</hi> who Annually with great formality and Solemnity, Excommunicate their moſt <hi>Catholick King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> every <hi>Maunday Thurſday,</hi> for keeping away part of St. <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> and with as great Formality and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity abſolve him again on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> without giving any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, witneſs alſo the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who upon the cloſe with <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, ſo ſlighted all his <hi>Monitories, Interdicts, Excommunications</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> that they did not only refuſe <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Benediction</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, but alſo refuſed to give him the <hi>Ordinary ſatisfaction of words,</hi>

The <hi>Pope</hi> finding himſelf thus baffled and ſlighted, did not deſiſt, but had recourſe unto little pittiful tricks, and Subterfuges, and therefore ſuffered to go abroad and to be divulged Four <hi>Counterfeit Writings.</hi> 1. A <hi>Breve</hi> to <hi>Cardinal Joyeuſe,</hi> which gave faculty to take away Cenſures. 2. An Inſtrument of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, dated <hi>April</hi> 21: 3.

And this Policy hath often ſucceeded well to theſe men, who have many times given colour to many ſuch falſe Writings, prejudicial to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes. So <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second ſerved <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the Office of <hi>Mozarabes.</hi> So <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1 199. ſaith that the Interdict againſt <hi>France,</hi> (becauſe <hi>King Philip Augustus</hi> had put away his Wife <hi>Iſemberge</hi>) was obſerved in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when there was no ſuch thing.

               <p>§.

Did they but ſeriouſly conſider, 1. That they, like Gods own <hi>Sabbath</hi> were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for men, and not men for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> nor yet for <hi>Popes,</hi> that what Powers ſoever of Right belongs unto them, they are given unto them for the good and benefit of Chriſtians, and not to Tyrannize or <hi>Lord it over Gods Heritage.</hi> 2. That <hi>God</hi> hath not given unto <hi>Popes</hi> any greater Authority in the Government of their Dominions, whether of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> than unto other <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom God hath alſo confirmed and ratified all Power that is neceſſary for the good of the Governed: And as it appertaineth not to other <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> to govern <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> ſo it doth as little appertain to <hi>Popes</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> either <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> of other <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> 3. That no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were or ever will be contented with a Government, which tends more to the benefit, grandeur, pomp and pride of life of thoſe that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, than to the good and comfort of thoſe that are governed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural and fundamental right of the governed, to apply and devolve as much of their own power, without diveſting themſelves thereof as they pleaſe, to one or more Perſons, ſubject nevertheleſs to the truſts repoſed in them, to be alwayes imployed and improved to the behoof and benefit of the governed. 4. That all people do with ſome contentedneſs, endure a reaſonable Bond, but from an exceſſive one, every one doth naturally endeavor by all means, tho indirect, to free themſelves.

               <p>His next Fortreſs,<note place="margin">Ch. <hi>Novit</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> is the Chapter <hi>Novit,</hi> which becauſe it moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned <hi>John King of England,</hi> you ſhall have the true ground and Hiſtory thereof. This Chapter <hi>Novit de Judiciis</hi> was indeed admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well deſigned and well Calculated for Papal Grandeur and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but not in the leaſt, (what pretence ſoever was held out) for the <hi>juſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50679:111"/>right of Kings</hi> or of any other <hi>Mode of Civil Government,</hi> good of Chriſtians, or glory of God. It was deſigned purpoſely by <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, to trample on the necks of Kings, as once that Monſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Third did on the proſtrate neck of the Emperor <hi>Frederick Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa,</hi> blaſphemouſly arrogating to himſelf for his warrant <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lion and Adder, the young Lion and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under thy feet,</hi> (as if <hi>David</hi> more than 1000 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any Pope, ſhould particularly Propheſie of Popes.) And he followed this blow with all the might he had, by endeavoring to put it in practice on <hi>John King of England,</hi> and <hi>Philip Augustus King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> But the truth is, he wanted the Welch-mans Back-ſword with two Edges, for he neither had the true Bilbo-blade, Temporal Power, ſufficient to force obedience: nor yet the Sword of the Spirit, Rightful Authority, to do what he did. He only ſent out his Voice, yea and that a mighty voice, by thundring out his abominable <hi>Excommunications,</hi> which only proved to be <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil.</hi> Take the Scene and Hiſtory as it then lay. After long Wars between <hi>Philip Augustus King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Richard King of England.</hi> About <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1199. <hi>Richard</hi> died, and his Brother <hi>John</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Lackland</hi> ſucceeded him, either by the Nomination or appointment of his Brother, as ſome affirm, or by Uſurpation upon <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Geoſſery</hi> another Elder Brother of his. But thoſe Territories which <hi>John</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>France,</hi> ſubmitted themſelves to the Dominion of <hi>Arthur,</hi> followed the faction of the <hi>French King,</hi> and was ſupported by him. But at length about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1200. by means of a Marriage between <hi>Lewis</hi> Son and Heir, and Succeſſor of the <hi>French King,</hi> and <hi>Blanche</hi> of <hi>Castile, King John</hi>'s Siſters Daughter (of which Marriage iſſued afterwards St. <hi>Lewis</hi>) A Peace was concluded between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> wherein <hi>Arthur</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compriſed; upon this Condition, that <hi>John</hi> ſhould do <hi>Homage</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> for the Dominions of <hi>Brittany</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> ſhould do Homage for the ſame unto <hi>John.</hi> After this upon ſome occaſion that fell out, <hi>Arthur</hi> was put in Priſon by his Uncle the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and there died, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1203. and the common opinion was, that he was murthered by his Uncles command, whereupon <hi>Philip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> as Chief Lord of the Fee, cauſed <hi>John</hi> to be cited to <hi>Paris:</hi> and upon default of his appearance, condemned him, and confiſcated thoſe Territories which he held of him, and went afterwards with an Army to ſeize them into his hands by force. <hi>John</hi> pretended that this was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Peace and Treatiſe between them, and made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, who <hi>commanded both the Kings</hi> upon pain of <hi>Excommunication</hi> to keep Peace, and to ſurceaſe from War, and ſent alſo a Legate unto them for that purpoſe. <hi>John</hi> for whoſe advantage this Commandment was, did gladly embrace, but <hi>Philip</hi> found himſelf much grieved, and took great exceptions againſt it, and ſo did the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>France</hi> in this behalf, unto whom <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third made that anſwer contained in the Chapter <hi>Novit. Philip</hi> for all that deſiſted not from his former purpoſe, but went on and conquered by the Sword, all the Territories that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time poſſeſſed in <hi>France:</hi> neither could the <hi>Pope</hi> prevail any thing by his Commands. In the year 1208. <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third Excommunicated <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Interdicted</hi> his <hi>whole Kingdom,</hi> which continued ſix years and three months, yet did not <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:50679:112"/>yield to obey the <hi>Pope</hi> in that he required of him. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſent <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi> his <hi>Legate</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> to perſwade him to make War upon <hi>John. Philip</hi> made his preparations accordingly, and many <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> combined themſelves with him, but in the mean time <hi>Pandulphus</hi> coming into <hi>England,</hi> and letting <hi>John</hi> ſee the danger he was in, adviſed him to become the Popes <hi>Foedatary. John</hi> enforced by the preſent peril, accepted the advice, and made his Kingdom Tributary to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to pay him yearly 1000 <hi>Marks of Gold, Pandulphus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned into <hi>France,</hi> and commanded <hi>Philip</hi> upon pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, that he ſhould moleſt <hi>John</hi> no longer, as being now become the <hi>Foedatary</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>Philip</hi> refuſed to obey, and the War continued, whereupon in the year 1215. in the Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, Pope Innocent</hi> ſent out an Excommunication againſt all thoſe that moleſted <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> And for that Cauſe in the year 1216. Another <hi>Legate</hi> called <hi>Guallo</hi> went to <hi>Paris,</hi> who by vertue of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, commanded <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, to forbear to paſs with an Army into <hi>England,</hi> which they were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to do. But notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Lewis</hi> deſiſted not, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>John</hi>'s Kingdom with a great power, altho the ſame <hi>Guallo</hi> was gone over into <hi>England,</hi> and there ceaſed not dayly to thunder out his Excommunications. This War continued unto the death of <hi>John,</hi> after which <hi>Lewis</hi> had gotten many places of that Kingdom into his hands, made Truce for five years with <hi>Henry</hi> the Son of <hi>John</hi> who ſucceeded his Father. Thus you ſee how the very <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> can Handy, Dandy, play faſt and looſe with Kings themſelves.</p>
               <p>§. Concerning the deſperate damnable Doctrines of this Chapter <hi>Novit,</hi> little ought to be ſaid, for that they rather deſerve a Spunge than an anſwer, to be obliterated out of all Records, minds and memories, and becauſe <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> (a man of their own Leaven) hath taken great pains on that <hi>Can. Lec.</hi> 75. to give ſome tollerable interpretation, but can find none but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Decretal and all other of the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor muſt be underſtood, <hi>in foro poenitentiae.</hi> A lame ſhift to help a lame Dog over a ſtile; But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not be ſo conſined, he will extend it farther,<note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> and mark what follows, even according to men of <hi>Rome,</hi> that whoever will affirm (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth) that they are to be underſtood <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> ſhall have much ado to avoid the abſurdities and the utter overthrow of the Secular Power ordained of God, and the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the World, which will ariſe out of theſe Doctrines. For his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to conclude, that where Princes uſe their Power to the hurt of their own Souls, or their Peoples, and to the prejudice of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the <hi>Pope</hi> may take the matter in hand to redreſs it. If this muſt go for currant Doctrine, mark what will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> There is no action of man <hi>in Individuo,</hi> but it is either a good work, or it is a ſin. Now if it belongs to the <hi>Pope</hi> to exerciſe Juriſdiction over all Sins, and withall to take upon him <hi>to determine what is ſin,</hi> and what not, I ſay there is no longer any Prince but the Pope, nay farther, there is no place left for any private Government.</p>
               <p>In ſum, the Pope may (by this Doctrine) examine all Laws, all Edicts, all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, all Councils, all Succeſſions, all Tranſlation of Princes; he may call in queſtion, and examine all Inheritances and Contracts of all private Men,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50679:112"/>all Marriages, all Treatiſes of Peace and War between Prince and Prince, becauſe it belongs to the Shepherd to have a care of his Sheep. And this inference doth not only neceſſarily follow of this ſuppoſition, but it is alſo allowed by the Canoniſts that write upon that Chapter <hi>Novit.</hi> And yet nevertheleſs have the wiſeſt men, and of the moſt underſtanding, noted and taxed it to be full of <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> which to avoid, ſome have out of that Chapter <hi>Novit,</hi> framed a diſtinction where there can be none, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is one thing to judge of the matter or of the Action, or of the contract, and another to judge of the ſin: for if it be the <hi>Pope</hi>'s right to judge of all things as they are ſins, and to forbid them, and to enforce all men to obey his determinations therein, what is there more left then for the <hi>Prince</hi> to do? Not one of <hi>Democritus</hi>'s <hi>Moats:</hi> for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> hath taught us a very general Doctrine, that <hi>to judge whether any Law contain in it ſin or not, it belongs to the Pope, as it belongs to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judge, to determine whether a Civil Contract contain in it the ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it will neceſſarily follow,<note place="margin">Che il giudicare ſt una lege centient p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that not only the <hi>Pope,</hi> but every <hi>Eccleſiastical Judge</hi> ſhall have Power to determine all matters: for it can belong no more to him to judge whether a Contract offend in Uſury, than whether it contain any other wrong or Injury to his neighbor; for all that do ſo are ſins, as well as the other. And by the ſame reaſon it will belong to the <hi>Eccleſiastical Judge</hi> to determine of all manner of ſin. And in brief, becauſe there is no Action or Affair, either Publick or Private, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſin is not Incident, if it ſhall be in the Power of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Judge</hi> to determine and judge of it, and either to allow it or forbid it, and to enforce obedience to his own determinations. All tranſactions about Contracts, all Courts of Juſtice, and all private Families may well be transferred into the <hi>Biſhops Palace,</hi> good griſt to that Mill! But the true Chriſtian Doctrine, and the common practice all the World over, avoids all theſe abſurdities, ſubjecting all Crimes and Offences unto the Temporal Juriſdiction, according to the example of <hi>Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> who never pretended to have or exerciſe any Temporal coertion, or coactive Authority over (mens) ſins. And if the <hi>Pope</hi> were <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>true Vicar</hi> indeed, he would never uſurp more than ever Chriſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelf, or gave him Authority to do. The main buſineſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and of the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was to Teach and Preach dayly in the <hi>Temple, and in every Houſe Jeſus Christ, Acts</hi> 5.42. Thus you ſee that theſe very Doctrines contained in the Chapter <hi>Novit,</hi> need little of our Confutation, it is done to our hands by ſeveral of themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> they are too general, becauſe there muſt be excepted all internal motions of the mind, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power at all to judge, unleſs it be in <hi>foro Poenitentiae,</hi> (in which alſo every Prieſt hath equal power with himſelf (no pleaſing Doctrine at <hi>Rome</hi>) and of this ſort are the greateſt number of ſins. And their own <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts</hi> do generally agree, that in the <hi>Excommunications</hi> granted againſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> thoſe are not comprized which err mentally, ſo that they which attempt to defend as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz. that the Pope may judge of all ſins,</hi> they are forced to except the greater part of particular ſins. Beſides a <hi>Prince</hi> may ſin by breaking his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50679:113"/>own Laws, as the ſame St. <hi>Thomas</hi> proves, 1.2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 96. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. yet of this ſin, he cannot be judged of any but <hi>God</hi> alone, as <hi>Cajetane</hi> in that place declareth, ſhewing that <hi>in foro Poenitentiae,</hi> and in the ſight of God is all one in ſence. <hi>Certes,</hi> to affirm that a Prince tranſgreſſing his own Laws, ſhould be therein ſubject to the Cenſures of the <hi>Pope,</hi> were wholly to take away the Power and Authority of <hi>Princes.</hi> And to affirm that he ſhould be ſubject to them in other Crimes and not in that, were to overthrow the very ground of the reaſon preſuppoſed in that infamous Chapter <hi>Novit.</hi> Moreover it is very neceſſary, well to obſerve the very words of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. <hi>Intendimus decernere de peccato cujus ad nos pertinet ſine dubitatione Cenſura, quam in quemlibet exercere poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; debemus.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Ad officium nostrum ſpectat de quocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que peccato mortali corripere quemlibet Chriſtianum,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates, <hi>le tutti di Principi del mundo.</hi> All the Princes of the World (by which it is plain, he had more than an ordinary <hi>Pique</hi> at <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi>) Now if he be bound by the duty of his place <hi>(quia potestas noſtra non est ex homine ſed ex Deo)</hi> to denounce cenſures againſt every mortal ſin, and againſt every Chriſtian ſo offending, ſurely if he do it not, he ſins and endangers damnation to himſelf. And yet we do not find that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſends out any Cenſures againſt the <hi>Curtizans,</hi> the <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> of <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>profest Harlots,</hi> who yet abide and perſiſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in their ſins.

               <p>Now if <hi>Boniface</hi> intended it as a Declaration of <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> it were worthy our knowledge, to know by what right <hi>Clement</hi> could free the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>France</hi> from that ſubjection which <hi>God</hi> had appointed them unto, the caſe being very clear (according to their own Doctrine) that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot exempt any man from his own Power and Juriſdiction which he holds <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> ſo it undeniably follows, that if <hi>Boniface</hi> were in the right, <hi>Clement</hi> was in the wrong, and <hi>è contra, Pope</hi> againſt <hi>Pope,</hi> no news at all.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that which <hi>Boniface</hi> ſaith in that <hi>Extravagant, viz. ſi deviat terrena potestas judicabitur à potestate ſpirituali,</hi> that the <hi>Authority Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> when it erreth, ought to be corrected and rectified by the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> be a Declaration of the Law of God, yet then according to as wiſe, honeſt and learned of your own Fraternity as ever writ in your defence, it ought to be underſtood only for ſo much as concerns the Salvation of their Souls, and that only <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> and Abſtract from all Temporal Power of that kind which the <hi>Lawyers</hi> term <hi>Coactive,</hi> and that all the <hi>Eccleſiastical Power</hi> over <hi>Princes</hi> is therefore only <hi>Spiritual.</hi> And herein we ſhall not need to have recourſe to <hi>Signior Papa</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Pope:</hi> for that this kind of Authority is in every <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> how Heretical ſoever it be eſteemed by ſome <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> I will not ſay all. Now out of theſe three Authorities before mentioned <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludes, <hi>that a Temporal abſolute Prince, altho he recognize no other Temporal Prince for his Superior, yet of neceſſity he must recognize the Head of all Chriſtendom.</hi> Herein <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhews his admirable <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> in uſing terms of divers ſignifications, applicable to one or the other ſence, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amuze and catch the inadvertent and leſs ſollicitous Reader. It had been much more for his Honor, to have defended his propoſitions by ſome other means, rather than by relying on our ſottiſhneſs, in not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his Sophiſtical Arts and Cunning, wherewith he goeth about to deceive us.</p>
               <p>So that the Author's drift out of this whole diſcourſe, is to conclude, that where <hi>Princes</hi> uſe their Power to the hurt of their <hi>own Souls,</hi> or their <hi>Peoples,</hi> and to the prejudice of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> may
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50679:114"/>take the matter in hand to redreſs it. According to theſe Doctrines, after this rate of arguing and handling, no <hi>Prince</hi> can be ſafe. For ſuppoſe any <hi>King, Protestant</hi> or <hi>Papist,</hi> all a caſe, go about to lay a Tax for the defence of his State againſt an Enemy, this Impoſition is not juſt but ſinful, unleſs the end and ground of it be lawful, and <hi>unleſs his Subjects do conſent thereunto</hi> according to the Rules of <hi>Justitia distributiva,</hi> now comes <hi>Signior Papa,</hi> and ſayes, I will know the end why this Tax is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſo he may dive into the <hi>Secrets of the State,</hi> and may alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the diſtribution, and indeed come to pry into and know all <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> condition and ſtrength, or feebleneſs of every Nation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Temporal Prince</hi> himſelf, may in that right and quality, wage War with any other <hi>Prince,</hi> on very eaſie and advantageous terms to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>So Zealous an Advocate is <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to aſcribe <hi>Almighty power</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he deems it no great matter <hi>(non è gran coſa che il Papa ſia stimato un dio in terra) that the Pope ſhould be reputed a God upon Earth,</hi> ſeeing it is attributed to Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> nor yet inconvenient <hi>(ne è inconveniente che ſidica che il Papa habbia ogni po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testa in cielo &amp; in terra, poiche Christo ha detto)</hi> to affirm that the Pope hath all power in Heaven and in Earth, becauſe <hi>Christ</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>whatſoever thou ſhalt bind upon Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.18.) to ſay that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath all power in Heaven and in Earth. (<hi>Perche puo fare tutto quello che è ceceſſario a condurre L'anime in Paradiſo, &amp; puo levare tutti gli impedimenti, che il mundo o' l' Demonio con tutta la lore forza, o astutia poſſino opporre onde S.</hi> Cyrillo <hi>citato da S.</hi> Tomaſo <hi>nel' opuſculo de primatu</hi> Petri, <hi>dice che ſi come Christo hebbe dal Padre pieniſſima poteſta ſopra tutta le chieſa: coſi Chriſto diede à ſan</hi> Petro, <hi>&amp; alli ſuoſi ſucceſſori, pieniſſima potesta ſopra tutto la chieſa.</hi>) <hi>for that he is able to do all that which is neceſſary to the conducting of Souls to Paradiſe, and can take away all the Impediments which the World or the Devil with all their force or craft are able to oppoſe,</hi> whence it is that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> cited by St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in his <hi>Opuſcle de Primatu Petri,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that as Christ had from the Father all plenitude of power over all the Church, ſo Chriſt had given to St.</hi> Peter <hi>and to his Succeſſors all plenitude of power over all the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. That the <hi>Pope</hi> be termed a <hi>God</hi> in that ſence as is attributed to <hi>Princes Pſalm</hi> 82.6. which St. <hi>John</hi> 10.34. expounds to be due unto all thoſe <hi>unto whom the word of God came,</hi> being all Children of the moſt high, and the Scriptures cannot be broken (tho <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endeavors it on every occaſion) may be no great matter indeed, but to conclude from thence and from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. as he doth, <hi>that the Pope is God upon Earth, and to believe it not Inconvenient to hold that the Pope hath all power in Heaven and in Earth, &amp;c.</hi> what is it leſs than <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in the higheſt degree, and as much as in him lyeth, by thus perverting of Scriptures, to break them into all <hi>Blaſphemous pieces and ſences.</hi> Theſe Texts are true, and have a Divine good meaning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ambiguity, but out of theſe to draw falſe conſequences, <hi>viz. Papa &amp; Deus conſtituunt Idem Tribunal. Papae &amp; Dei idem conſiſtorium,</hi> what I ſay, can it be leſs than Blaſphemy, thus to aſcribe a kind of <hi>Deity</hi> to the <hi>Pope, who yet ſhall dye like man, and fall like one of the Princes?</hi> If this be not <hi>Deum falſum pro vero colere,</hi> I do not know what is. He
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50679:114"/>alſo thinks it no inconvenience, to ſay, that the <hi>Pope hath all power in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> becauſe it is ſad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven,</hi> of which Text I have ſaid ſo much before of the abuſe thereof, that I ſhall only ſay here, that this concluſion cannot be well drawn from this place, becauſe power belongs to the Active property, and <hi>quodcunque</hi> belongs to the matter. If I ſhould ſay that the <hi>Pariſh Prieſt</hi> is he that makes all Marriages, it doth not therefore follow that he hath all power in making of Marriages. For to ſay <hi>quodcunque ligaveris, &amp;c.</hi> therefore <hi>quocunque modo ligaveris</hi> after what manner ſoever thou bindeſt, be it right or wrong follows not. The Propoſition it ſelf, <hi>viz the Pope hath all power in Heaven and on Earth,</hi> being taken abſolutely is abſolutely falſe: or being conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mildeſt conſtruction, there is much more power both in Heaven and in Earth, than the Pope hath. If His Holineſs ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated as <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>Knowest thou the Ordinances of Heaven? Canſt thou ſet the Dominion thereof in the Earth? Hast thou an Arm like God? Or canst thou thunder with a Voice like him? Canst thou ſend lightnings, that may go and ſay unto thee, here we are?</hi> What could he anſwer? Would he not with <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>I am a Worm and not Man?</hi>

I admire Gods inſinite patience and mercy, yet wonder that they have hitherto eſcaped the Judgment of <hi>Herod,</hi> and have not long ere this <hi>been eaten up of Vermin,</hi> becauſe to this very day they have not given <hi>God the glory</hi> by expunging all ſuch expreſſions (bordering ſo near upon, nay indeed are the quinteſcence of Blaſphemy) out of their extravagants and Decretals, Canons and Authors, when by their <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> they have obliterated and expunged many Divine Truths out of the Antient Fathers and Books, nay out of God's own Commandements, out of his own <hi>Decalogue, written with his own finger on Tables of Stone,</hi> and ſplit another into two, that the ſame number might ſtill remain. And are they thus <hi>Hogen Mogen</hi> in words only? Have not their Acts and Enterpriſes been anſwerable?

               <p>To anſwer which I muſt preliminarily once more Interrogate His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <hi>Who hath put wiſdom in the inward parts?

Wilt thou then diſanul his Judgments? Wilt thou rob him of his glory, that thou maiſt ſeem righteous,</hi> or that thou maiſt be <hi>Dominus fac totum?</hi> To conduct the Soul of an Infant into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, which is yet in the <hi>Mothers Womb,</hi> and cannot be brought forth alive, neceſſary it is one way or other to make it partaker of Grace, can the Pope do it? I trow not. For neither can he inſtitute a Sacrament for this purpoſe, nor grant that the Child ſhould be cut out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Belly, and therefore the Pope cannot do any thing neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct this Soul into Paradice. According to like <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine, a man being Actually in ſome mortal ſin, and in this State deprived of his Wits, cannot be ſaved unleſs he recover his wits again, and repent himſelf, can the Pope reſtore him to his wits again? I trow not, and yet according to their own Doctrine it is neceſſary for this Mans Salvation. But if he can, he ſhall have my Vote to be Doctor to all the <hi>Bedlams</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>Nothing more neceſſary to Salvation, than the Internal motions of the mind. Can the Pope influence the Hearts of men, by ſecret Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſuggeſtions, and illapſes of the Spirit?

How ſhall we poor Laicks now behave our ſelves, when ſo great School-men cannot agree the point? one accounting it a meritorious Act to reſiſt, and the other Rebellion and a kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not to obey <hi>Christ's Vicar.</hi> Firſt <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> wrote 150 years before <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s anſwer came out, being in a quiet and ſedate temper, not ingaged in any diſputes, and conſequently without Bias, and void of paſſion: on the other ſide <hi>Bellarmine</hi> then liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deeply ingaged in that great Controverſie between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> about Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical Power, and conſequently more ſubject to paſſion and Intereſt, very ſtrong Biaſſes. Let us now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Texts of Scripture and reaſons, the firſt is the part of the ſame <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. as before, and muſt in part receive the ſame Anſwer, <hi>viz. he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me,</hi> which words were undoubtedly ſpoken to the Seventy Diſciples which repreſented the Preachers, which were to publiſh Chriſts Doctrine, and not to <hi>Peter</hi> ſingly: ſo that what power ſoever devolves by this Text on <hi>Chriſts Vicar,</hi> it is but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the reſt of his Fellow Prieſts and Biſhops, ſo that he can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing peculiar to himſelf from this Text.</p>
               <p>To this Text we will oppoſe, and leave to their conſideration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.45. that at the day of Judgment Chriſt will ſay to the Reprobate, <hi>Quatenus &amp; in as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me,</hi> and likewiſe we ſhall oppoſe the 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. But <hi>who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the depth of the Sea,</hi> ſo that there is Authority of Scripture, to ſhew that Chriſt takes it for an injury done unto himſelf, that is done unto the leaſt of his Faithful Servants. But of <hi>Chriſts Vicar</hi> not one word, not ſo much as once named in the whole Bible, a term never heard of till about <hi>Anno</hi> 666.</p>
               <p>So that he <hi>which deſpiſeth,</hi> &amp;c. is alledged out of its natural ſence by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and in as much ye did it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alledged in its proper ſence, for that admonition or correction is indeed a work of Charity, and incumbent on all Chriſtians, ſo it be done with prudence and with due obſervance of circumſtances. And on the contrary <hi>cum Authoritate
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50679:117"/>imperare &amp; cum potentia,</hi> is againſt Charity. Beſides the very conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words, <hi>qui vos ſpernit, &amp;c.</hi> cannot poſſibly bear it, no more than <hi>Dic Eccleſiae</hi> can reaſonably be underſtood of the Pope a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for I never underſtood that Popes had Pigs in their Bellies, tho I will not ſwear what Pope <hi>Joan</hi> had in her Weem, when ſhe was Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Son in the open Street, as ſhe went to St. <hi>John Laterans.</hi> So that the 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. is to be underſtood of all Miniſters in General, among whom I will not deny His Holineſs <hi>Quatenus</hi> a Prieſt or Biſhop, to have a right in Common with the reſt of his Brethren, but no other or greater. For in the beginning Biſhops and Prieſts were all one, their Inſtitution, Commiſſion, Imploy and Duties were all one and the ſame, and how, when, and by whom they came to be differenced and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and an Eccleſiaſtical Regiment erected and regulated by <note n="*" place="margin">Canon Law.</note> Laws of their own making, whereby they have Metamorphos'd it from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy of all the Brethren together, to an abſolute Eccleſiaſtical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, nay Tyranny of a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> is not very hard to trace, tho very hard to remedy.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Quaker</hi> like a <hi>bold Britain</hi> ſhould <hi>Pilgrim</hi> it to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there reprove and rebuke the Pope of Popiſh errors, Superſtitions, and other falſe Doctrines, and that by plain Scripture: And the Pope ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and ſcorn him, not enduring ſound Doctrine, certainly at the day of Judgment, <hi>qui vos ſpernit, &amp;c.</hi> would be laid to the Charge of His Holineſs, and not unto the deſpicable Quaker, aſſuredly whoever <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the word of truth,</hi> tho in the mouth of the leaſt of God's little ones, <hi>deſpiſeth Chriſt.</hi> Teachings are not truth, becauſe uttered by the Supream <hi>Biſhop, Christ's Vicar,</hi> the <hi>Head of all Christendom,</hi> but becauſe they are grounded on Scripture the word of Truth, and ſo carry their own awe and warrant with them. <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſay 8.20. but they that will not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets (as no perverters of Scripture will) <hi>will not be perſwaded, tho one aroſe from the Dead,</hi> Luke 16.31. If the Apoſtles or an <hi>Angel from Heaven Preach any other Goſpel than that which they have preached,</hi> may not only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed but accurſed <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. then may not the Pope be deſpiſed, that thus troubles the Church, and labors to pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The next Scripture which he uſeth at the ſame rate is, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit non hominem ſpernit ſed Deum,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.8. <hi>He that deſpiſeth theſe things, deſpiſeth not Man but God,</hi> who hath alſo given unto us his Holy Spirit. How is it poſſible that this citation can be to the purpoſe? St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſiſted with the Holy Spirit applied <hi>qui haec ſpernit,</hi> to ſuch things there ſpoken by himſelf who could not erre, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>viz, that ye ſhould abſtain from Fornication: that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in Sanctification and honor: not in the lusts of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, even as the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which know not God,</hi> &amp;c. How then can it now be applied to the Pope, who for certain hath no other aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> than the reſt of his Brethren? Neither yet hath he ſaid himſelf, nor his <hi>Sycophants</hi> for him, that he hath any extraordinary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> ſaving only when he doth determine a matter <hi>de Fide ex Cathedra,</hi> and not when he gives Orders in a Stable. How can he then freely and righteouſly, according to their own Doctrine, in a Decree or an <hi>Extravagant,</hi> which is not in a matter of Faith, ſay, <hi>qui haec ſpernit,</hi> &amp;c. he that deſpiſeth theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50679:117"/>
               <p>When the Pope ſhall teach and command Gods own Indubitable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts we will not complain of him, if he add with all that <hi>he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth, &amp;c.</hi> but to equal Popes to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and their Decrees and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants to Canonical Scripture, and make them ſubſervient to their Dictates and Expoſitions. Is not this to make them lyable to the Plagues denounced againſt them that add or diminiſh from Gods word? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. And is it not a ſtrange Phanatick preſumption, and a ſin as great as the former, not to wreſt and miſapply the New Teſtament only, but to hook in the Old Teſtament alſo by Head and Ears to ſerve a wicked turn, and to make that intend the Pope alſo? <hi>&amp; questo diſpregiare Dio nel ſuo Vicario ſi chiama da</hi> Samuel <hi>Profeta,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.23. <hi>una ſorte d' Idolatria.</hi> And this deſpiſing God in his Vicar, is called by <hi>Samuel</hi> a <hi>kind of Idolatry.</hi> If one ſhould retort and ſay, that ſo to expound <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> is a kind of Nonſence, what could be ſaid againſt it?

There <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> as a Prophet by Gods expreſs Precept ſharply rebukes <hi>Saul,</hi> telling him, that <hi>Obedience was more acceptable to God than Sacrifice,</hi> and that it was as the ſin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not to reſt upon his Commandment. And ſhall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> now put a humane Precept ſubject to errors in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with an expreſs Precept from God, by a ſlight of wreſting of Scripture <hi>Impune.</hi> Can any Man that hath any ſpark of Grace bear it with patience, that Humane Precepts ſhould be thus equalled with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? It is horrid Impiety, thus to match and rank any man with <hi>God Almighty.</hi> It is Goſpel-like to perſwade due obedience and reverence to the word of <hi>God</hi> in the Mouths of Prelates, but to enhaunce and inlarge it beyond its juſt bounds, is rather to abuſe and villifie than advance it. Who can but wonder and ſtand amazed, that <hi>Samuel</hi> above 1100 years before there was any Pope, or Prediction that there ſhould be one, or any deſcription what manner of Perſon this omnipotent Vicar ſhould be, ſhould yet by ſaying, that not to obey Gods expreſs Precept delivered by the mouth of his Prophet, is as it were <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſhould thereby intend the Pope: And that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould conclude from hence, that to deſpiſe God in his Vicar, is called by <hi>Samuel, a kind of Idolatry.</hi> Put all this together. 1. That <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpake of <hi>Saul</hi> a King, <hi>becauſe thou haſt rejected the word of the Lord</hi> (not of a Pope or of his Vicar) <hi>he hath alſo rejected thee from being King.</hi> 2.

That <hi>Christ's Vicar</hi> in the New Teſtament may (by their own Confeſſion) err, except in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith <hi>è Cathedra.</hi> With what colour or ſhew of ingenuity or reaſon can this their great <hi>Goliah Bellarmine</hi> aver, that <hi>Samuel</hi> terms this deſpiſing of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Vicar a kind of Idolatry?

And altho the Popes have nothing at all to do with this kind of Government, nor as yet <hi>in terminis</hi> have laid any claim thereunto, yet their <hi>Illuſtriſſimo Bellarmine</hi> hath had ſuch effronted Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence as to aver, <hi>that the Pope is able to do all that which is neceſſary to the Conducting of Souls to Paradiſe, (unto which end certainly Divine Inſpiration is most neceſſary) and can take away all Impediments which the World or the Devil with all their force or Craſt are able to oppoſe,</hi> which doth covertly inſinuate and attribute the ſame Spiritual Inviſible power to be alſo in the Pope, hoping it will not be ſeen, but it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, for without ſuch Inſluences and aſſiſtances it is very improbable if not altogether impoſſible to be conducted to Heaven, and if <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s Doctrine be good, what need of petitioning Heaven for Graces, it is but going to <hi>Rome,</hi> a pleaſant Journey, where we may have all things neceſſary for our Journey to Paradiſe for asking, for ſome merry Pence, <hi>Romae omnia venalia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the external Government of his Body and Church Militant here on Earth, it conſiſts here of viſible men:<note place="margin">The Church to be Governed by its own Body.</note> So <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf would that it ſhould be governed by viſible men without diveſting himſelf of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual influences: and in order thereunto he appointed <hi>Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministery, for the Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8, 11, 12. Who having in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time endowed them with power and commands <hi>to teach all Nationis Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. which is all the Authority that ever Chriſt gave or bequeathed unto them, and which is purely Spiritual without any mixture Temporal, and that only as Miniſters and Servants (not as Lords) of his Body, which power tho it may be peculiar to the Clergy of the Church as chief Officers and Miniſters thereof, yet the application of the ſame Authority to the perſon is purely elective and depending on the Body: hence it follows that the Body or Sheep having choſen their <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Pastor,</hi> he is now become ſubject to the <hi>Body</hi> (and not the <hi>Body</hi> to him) which Authority of chooſing them a good or of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of cenſuring a wicked <hi>Paſtor</hi> being given them of Chriſt their Head and Father, they cannot wave or devolve the ſame, without committing great offence againſt God, and if they ſhould, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wholly diveſt themſelves thereof. Beſides in diſputes among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50679:119"/>whether the Pope be above a Council, very many of the moſt Learned of them do argue and agree, that as the Head or Superior of the Inquiſition is not Superior to the whole Congregation of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being aſſembled, nor do they admit that the reſt of the Body hath no power over the Head, eſpecially being ſuch a Head as the Body it ſelf hath conſtituted. They argue the like alſo from the examples of Kings and Kingdoms, of which I ſhall make this uſe only, that if theſe be good inſtances among themſelves to prove a Council to be above the Pope, it will hold alſo <hi>in minor</hi> collective Eccleſiaſtical Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thus do they abuſe all places of Scripture by wreſting them from their proper meaning and intendment,<note place="margin">The Popes claims firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt then Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> as I have hitherto ſhewed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Readers may do well to bear in their memories the Cautions and Obſervations laid down in the <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> forementioned.

They claimed only precedency, or Primacy, not Supremacy: but now their Judgments are Infallible: their Juriſdiction Infinite: their <hi>Empire boundleſs:</hi> fetching in and Monopolizing all Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. <hi>All Biſhops but their Curates: All Kings and Emperors but their Vaſſals,</hi> for of the <hi>Pope</hi> was meant <hi>Gens &amp; regnum quod non ſervierit tibi eradicabitur,</hi> and this <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and others of the ſame Leaven plead for, not out of the <hi>Decretal Epistles,</hi> or <hi>Constantine</hi>'s <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> but out of Scripture. The firſt and beſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> thought more of their Martyrdom, than of an Univerſal Monarchy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture with contentedneſs, according to the natural ſence of the Text, without racking or torturing it unto wrong ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But their Succeſſors loſt by degrees firſt conſcience, then Learning, and now at laſt all Grace and Modeſty. This their <hi>Babel</hi> as it now ſtands, was not built in a day, but as the itching deſires of this or that proud and haughty Pope, of enlarging their <hi>Fringes</hi> and <hi>Phylacteries</hi> did increaſe: ſo their claims and pretentions increaſed therewith. At firſt they claimed a Primacy of Order, or at moſt of Honor, not of power among their Brethren only, not over them. And theſe conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were with Biſhops, not yet with Emperors, they medled yet only with the Keyes, not with the Swords, owning all their power to be meerly and purely Spiritual for the benefit of Souls, nothing at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly temporal. But when once they had put a Padlock on the Scriptures, and Preached Ignorance up to be the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, then the Myſtery of Iniquity became quickly advanced to that monſtrous height; which at this day we ſee but cannot remedy. And the better to ſet out this Pageant, not only ſome ſcraps and ſhadows of old Fathers and Councils, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> are brought upon the Stage, and rackt and tortured to do obeyſance unto this Monſter of Iniquity: whereas we may ſafely ſwear that there is not one word or Syllable of the Pope or his Power in all the Scripture Old or New, but what is due to all Biſhops in Common with him (ſave only as he is deſcribed to be <hi>Anti-Christ, Theſſ.</hi> 2.2.) yet theſe men with the Quinteſcence of Sophiſtry, have obſerved many new Myſteries in the Old and New Teſtament, and plainly ſee the Pope in all his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> in many Texts thereof which we may ſafely ſwear

               </p>
               <p>I can eaſily be perſwaded to believe, that Papiſts do underſtand the true Scope and meaning of that Text and Chapter, <hi>viz. Iſay</hi> 60.12. as well as we, but I cannot be ſo eaſily perſwaded, that they who draw ſuch wrong Concluſions out of ſuch right Premiſſes do believe themſelves, I doubt they rather preſume to out-wit us by their Subtilties and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry then convince us by ſound reaſon.</p>
               <p>The whole Scope and purport of that Chapter, is only to ſet forth the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the abundant Acceſs of the Gentiles, and the great and glorious bleſſings that ſhall accrew unto them after a ſhort aſſliction. Now if by intendment of the Prophet, the Pope is meant by the 12. Verſe, we ſhall have brave Popes indeed, for then unto them alſo muſt neceſſarily belong all thoſe other glorious Attributes Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Chapter, for they all are relatives tending and pointing unto one and the ſame thing, and if they belong unto <hi>Signior Papa,</hi> then by the rule of conſequences, <hi>is the glory of the Lord riſen upon them, and darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, and groſs darkneſs the People: but the Lord ſhall ariſe upon him, and his glory ſhall be ſeen upon him,</hi> v. 1, 2. <hi>and the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall come to his light, and Kings to the brightneſs of his riſing,</hi> v. 3. <hi>And the Sons of Strangers ſhall build up his Walls, and their Kings ſhall Minister unto him: his Gates ſhall be open continually, they ſhall noi be ſhut day nor night, that men may bring unto him the forces of the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>and that their Kings may be brought: and the Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve him ſhall periſh,</hi> v. 10, 11, 12. <hi>And the Sons alſo of them that afflicted him, ſhall come and bow unto him, and all that deſpiſed him, ſhall fall down at the Soles of his Feet</hi> (to kiſs his Feet) <hi>and they ſhall call him</hi> (not the Vicar of Chriſt, but) <hi>the City of the Lord, the</hi> Sion <hi>of the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael, (not of <hi>Rome</hi>) v. 14. <hi>And God will make him an eternal excellency</hi> (not a Butcher of Kings and Saints, but) <hi>a joy of many Generations, and he ſhall ſuck the Milk of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and ſhall ſuck the Breaſts of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo to the end of the Chapter. Now either all theſe glorious Conſignments muſt belong peculiarly unto him, or not any one of them, as every one that hath learnt his Grammer can eaſily tell. And he that is but little verſed in Scripture can tell, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to him, but unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this appropriating unto himſelf Attributes Divine, leſs <hi>than to oppoſe and exalt himſelf above all that is called God, or that is Worſhipped: ſo that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.4. who I beſeech you is more omnipotent, Chriſt the eternal Head and Law-giver of his Body the Church, or his <hi>Romiſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> that claims to Interpret and diſpence with God's own Laws at his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50679:120"/>pleaſure? I wonder if ever ſuch Blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Now under theſe borrowed figurative Speeches, the Prophet deſcribes the Glory of the Church of the Gentiles, and more eſpecially of Chriſt the Head thereof, and doth thereby denote Chriſt's Spiritual Worſhip and Service, and not the leaſt hint of any Temporal Dominion to be devolved on <hi>Nostro Signior Papa,</hi> ſo the Texts are admirable, and true in their own proper ſenſe and meaning, but the Application of them made by the Papiſts is erroneous, nay devilliſh even from their Father the Devil. This miſapplication of Texts is the general vein of Fallacy, that runs quite thro moſt Popiſh Interpreters, deſcanting on Texts of Scripture. Now Kings and Kingdoms ſerve the Church, not in that ſhe exerciſeth any Temporal Dominion of her ſelf, but becauſe God hath given and committed the Sceptre of his Word (by which he Rules and Governs) unto the Churches Care and Cuſtody: So the Homage of bowing and falling down at the Soles of his Feet, are honors indeed, but not due to the Pope, but to their and our Head Chriſt bleſſed for ever, who is worſhipped in the Church, not as Papiſts deem, who think they Worſhip Chriſt when they kiſs his Vicars Pantable with the Croſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered upon it, but when they ſerve and honor him by obeying his voice in the Miniſtery of his word, ſo the Strangers and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould willingly ſubmit themſelves to yield obedience unto Chriſt, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhines in the Doctrine which himſelf Adminiſters by the Service of men: ſo by Milk and Breaſts are meant the Service and Obedience the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould render unto the Church to nouriſh her off-ſpring, ſo all theſe ſigurative expreſſions muſt be referred to the Spiritual Eſtate of the Church, that God may be purely worſhipped in her, that the Miniſtery of the word may be advanced by all the Sons of the Church, unto which the Pope is as much obliged as the meaneſt of his Vaſſals: by all which it is apparent, that there is not one <hi>Jota</hi> of that Text giving the leaſt Temporal Power to the Pope, over Kings and Princes.</p>
               <p>In this, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Kings ſerve God, if in their Kingdoms they command that which is good, and prohibit that which is evil, not in Temporal affairs only, but in matters of Religion alſo, <hi>Cont. Creſc. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.1. And again, <hi>Ep.</hi> 48. Kings ſerve Chriſt in making Laws for Chriſt: ſo that commanding the People to reverence the word, and obey God, and the making of ſtrict Laws to keep men in the Faith and Church of Chriſt, that is the true ſervice which Princes owe to Chriſt, and his <hi>Sion</hi> his Church, and which Papiſts deny them to meddle withall, and endeavor to prove that Popes only, are Rulers of the Church (out of <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and unto all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overſeers to feed the Church of God.</hi> And out of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.7.17. <hi>Remember them which have the Rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the word of God, whoſe faith follow, obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls,</hi> &amp;c.) Not conſidering that the word <hi>Rulers</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s dialect, doth ſignifie <hi>Feeders and Leaders,</hi> which be the two ſigns and duties of good Shepards: And yet we do not deny but that the Meſſengers and diſpencers of God's Myſteries by Preaching the word, Adminiſtring the Sacraments and Rights, uſeing the Keys, have their Internal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Regiment over the Souls, as well of Princes as of others.

               <p>§. <hi>Si fas ſit divinare,</hi> may we not probably conjecture that Confeſſion, tho inſignificant in it ſelf, yet by the moſt excellent management of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with ſome apprehenſions on one ſide, and happily ſome <hi>Menaces</hi> on the other, of being ſent the ſame way after their Predeceſſors, to be one of their chief Charmes? For tho Confeſſion (practiſed as it ought) may be both convenient and uſeful, yet that it cannot be performed but by a Prieſt, is beſides all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common ſenſe. It is ſtoried, that if a man, ſtruck with a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 28. c. 10.</note> do immediately whiſper it in the ear of an Aſs, he ſhall find ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den eaſe: A ſtory as credible as that without Confeſſion to a Prieſt, no Abſolution can enſue. The Common-law of Nature, and Civil Law of Man kind, teacheth that unto every man juſtly offended, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is juſtly due. Our neighbor is ſatisfied by Confeſſion and Reſtitution of the wrong done to the offended, without the help of a Prieſt. And if a Prieſt do wrong to one of his Pariſhioners, the Prieſt is obliged to Confeſs to him and not to his fellow-Prieſt, and Abſolution will follow accordingly. If a Prince offend or wrong but one of his Black Guard, and he confeſs and reſtore the wrong done to him, he hath more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to forgive and abſolve him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> p. 96, 97.</note> than all the Popes and Prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> Confeſs and Abſolve as they pleaſe. I know they pretend Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to juſtifie their inſignificant Sacramental Confeſſion (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of a Sacrament in it,) but their ill hap is ſuch, that there is not one plain Text in all the Bible that warrants it, and therefore they fly unto conjectural conſequences, in which they have the ſame ill fate, for that the Premiſes cannot poſſibly yield the Concluſions they draw from them. Beſides, they would very much oblige us if they would but impart unto us any good intent they have or poſſibly can have to pry into other mens boſom-ſins, when they do no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, nor can they remedy or pardon them more than any other private man. <hi>He that confeſſeth</hi> (to God) <hi>and forſaketh his ſins, they are forgiven,</hi> whether a Prieſt be concerned therein or not, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50679:127"/>without forſaking, (confeſs or not confeſs) no Pardon enſues. <hi>Scire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta domus,</hi> cannot then be to any good intent, and can only be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to make themſelves Maſters of the very ſouls and bodies, lives and fortunes of the confeſſed, that they may lead them Captive at their pleaſure, to accompliſh their own wicked deſigns, tho to Hell it ſelf in purſuit of them: And to make Confeſſion yet a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Inſtrument and Myſtery of Iniquity, they pin and hang upon it another <hi>Buckram Sacrament of Penance,</hi> by which the worſt and vileſt ſins that are may be pardoned on very eaſie terms, and then who that can be perſwaded to believe theſe Doctrines, will not adventure to kill Kings, or do any thing that is worſe if worſe can be? When on a ſlight Confeſſion and as ſlight a Penance, they ſhall as eaſily be abſolved by thoſe that ſet them a work?</p>
               <p>Sad and lamentable examples liereof were <hi>Henry</hi> the Third and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> brave Princes fearleſs and undaunted in War, and in all Heroick Actions how difficult ſoever, yet cow'd, daunted and Butcher'd by theſe men, notwithſtanding their compliances with them: changed the beſt Religion in the World (in which they had been brought up) and imbraced the worſt even Romiſh Superſtitions to gratifie them, deſigning thereby to ſave their lives, but in vain: Whereas <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> profeſſed the ſame Religion they were brought up in, withſtood the Papiſts to their faces, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Dags and Daggers, dyed in Peace and in her Bed, full of dayes and full of Honour.</p>

Was King <hi>James</hi> free from their Conſpiracies either here or in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Do they not boaſt at this very day, that notwithſtanding all that hath been done, diſcovered and executed, that ſtill their Plot drives on, and boaſt that it is ſo deeply laid, that it cannot be diſcovered nor prevented! Beſides, what ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can they poſſibly give for their peaceable deportment? They are Devotees ſworn to another Forreign Head, and Oaths made to us, are not of any force to oblige them according to their own Maxim, <hi>Nulla Fides ſervanda cum Haereticis,</hi> and therefore we have no reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in them, but to ſecure our ſelves. Do they not compaſs Sea and Land, and dayly <hi>pervert the right wayes of the Lord,</hi> by making divers Proſelytes, and them thereby two fold more the Children of Hell than they were before? Have they changed their Principles? Or are their Contrivances and Plottings againſt Church and State, even at this very day leſs numerous or leſs dangerous than at any time heretofore? Can we be ſo blind as not to ſee, not to perceive that they are playing their old Games over again, and that they will Iterate and Reiterate them again and again, as from Age to Age they have hitherto ſucceſſively done? And is it not then profound reaſon of State in us, and pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to boot, to give this <hi>Crudele genus,</hi> theſe unreaſonable blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty men more Countenance, more freedom, more power amongſt us by nouriſhing them in our boſoms, <hi>qui vult decipi decipiatur,</hi> my Prayer ſhall be, from this ill kind of men, <hi>Libera nos Domine,</hi> and I do not doubt, but that all true and ſincere <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants (having Souls, Bodies and Eſtates to ſave, loving God, their King and their Country) will think themſelves highly oblidged by all theſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tenures, to the beſt of their power and knowledge, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true Proteſtant Eſtabliſhed Religion, which ſtands Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to all the forementioned abominable Errors, and will not hazard their Temporal Eſtates, much leſs the Eternal wellfare of their immortal Souls by a ſinful compliance, and Kings and Princes leaſt of all, for that there is no Prince nor Nation that will not ſubmit to the Pope, that is not marked out for deſtruction under the Notion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which notion (as ſoon as a neat opportunity preſents) tho miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed (which is not ſeldom) ſerves his turn for all Aſſaſſinations, Wars, Maſſacres, what not? What hath been written, with reflection on the State of our Neighbor Nations, and on the intereſt and inceſſant workings of the Jeſuits, in all their Courts and Councils, doth manifeſt ſufficiently our happineſs, without any ſuch ſinful compliance, and ſpares me the labor of farther characterizing them.</p>

            <head>AN APOLOGY FOR THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I cannot with truth aver, that ſtealing out in Print, <hi>ſine permiſſu ſuperiorum,</hi> is as juſtifiable as ſtealing a Nap, or ſtealing away from Company at pleaſure, yet I hope it is not to be numbred <hi>inter graviora delicta:</hi> And that I may with much truth ſay, that to padlock the Preſs is but a new Trick or Tyranny, rather deviſed by thoſe whom for ſhame we cannot own for pious in their Lives, or orthodox in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and indeed, whom it is a reproach to imitate. A <hi>Romiſh Practice,</hi> or at beſt but a new <hi>Canonical Slight,</hi> (unknown to the firſt and pureſt Men and Times) forged in and crept out of the <hi>Saincted Inquiſition</hi> by the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> thereof, who to ſhew their wonderful zeal to Religion and divine Truths, have put the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf in the <hi>Front,</hi> or firſt rank of <hi>prohibited Books,</hi> and ſo corrupted the Fathers by their Additions and Subſtractions, that thoſe of their Inquiſitory Editions can no otherwiſe be eſteemed the true Off-ſpring of their Natural Fathers, then <hi>Theſeus</hi>'s Ship could be called his Ship, after it had ſo often been hack'd and hewed, patch'd and mended, that there was ſcarce a whole Rib or Plank that did remain the ſame that it was when it was firſt built, which becauſe it ſtill kept the ſame form, though little of the old matter, did ſtill retain the Name of <hi>Theſeus</hi> his Ship. Tho' <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have no other <hi>divine Rule or Authority</hi> without them warrantable to one another, as a common Ground or Rule, (either for holy Living, or determination of Controverſies in matters of Religion) unto which all ought to ſubmit but the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor any other Evidence or Patent, to make out their title or claim to <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> things, nor unto their <hi>great Goſpel-Priviledges,</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> yet ſo juſt and tender have the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fathers of all Chriſtendom, the Popes been, that contrary to all expreſs <hi>Apoſtolical Commands,</hi> by their <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> (whereof there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if not more extant) in the very front of prohibited Books placed the Bible, forbidding it to be printed or read in any vulgar Tongue printed or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, (and they account all Languages <hi>vulgar</hi> but <hi>Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick, Syriack, Aethiopick, Perſian, Arabick</hi>) as may be ſeen in the fifth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule in the <hi>Index</hi> printed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> 1667. viz. <hi>Cum experientia docue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ex permiſſione ſacrorum Bibliorum lingua vulgari plus inde ob hominum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritatem,

            </p>
            <p>By this holy <hi>Inquiſition</hi> alſo theſe men (ſo wiſe are they in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) have endeavoured to appropriate and monopolize unto themſelves the whole power of the Preſs, and as much as in them lyes, to <hi>cajole</hi> the ſecular power thereof, (and not without grand reaſon of State Eccleſiaſtick;) for they have been ſo dexterous at it, that they have already expunged the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors and Councils of all that makes for <hi>temporal Authority: Ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non fuit ſic.</hi> The matter of Fact ſtands thus; the reaſonableneſs of the Practice ſhall follow.</p>
            <p>In the primitive Church <hi>Heretical Books</hi> were examined and declared to be ſuch by the <hi>Councils,</hi> but not prohibited by them, nor by the <hi>Pope,</hi> but by the <hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>firſt Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> condemned the <hi>Heretical</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Arius;</hi> but <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> did forbid his Books by <hi>Imperial Law.</hi> The <hi>ſecond Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did declare <hi>Eunomias</hi> to be an Heretick; but the <hi>Emperor Arcadius</hi> did prohibit the Books of the <hi>Eunomians</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches</hi> by a Law, which is in the <hi>Theodoſian Code.</hi> The <hi>third Council</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> declared <hi>Nestorius</hi> to be an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and his Books were forbidden by a Law of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which is in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Civil Laws.</hi> The <hi>fourth Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and their Books were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by a Law of the <hi>Emperor Martian,</hi> which is in the ſame aforeſaid Book; and in <hi>Spain</hi> the King <hi>Ricaredus</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> This was the manner of the <hi>Church,</hi> until the year 800. ſince which Times the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have by Uſurpation declared divers Writers to be <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>heretical,</hi> that will not ſubſcribe to the Canons of that <hi>Conventicle of Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this while the <hi>Preſs</hi> was not guarded, nor <hi>Tranſcribing</hi> forbidden, but left free: Books only, and thoſe but few cenſured and prohibited until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the year 1200. and then alſo but ſparingly, until about the time of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff H-uſſe,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Praghe,</hi> which was about 1371. in the days of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2d. and <hi>Pope Martin</hi> 5th. who by his <hi>Bull excommunicated</hi> all Sects of <hi>Hereticks</hi> in their eſteem, eſpecially <hi>Wicklefists</hi> and <hi>Huſſites,</hi> and had recourſe alſo unto a ſtricter <hi>Guardianſhip</hi> of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> nay to <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Fagot</hi> alſo againſt them and their Books; and good reaſon and high time it was ſo to do, for that their Doctrines touched to the quick the Reformation of the <hi>Heretical Doctrines,</hi> and lewd practices of the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> and therefore that faithleſs and jugling <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in a time of Schiſm did condemn them, their<note n="*" place="margin">Counted to be 200 Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes by <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeas, Syliſias,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Cocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Hiſtoria Huſſitarum.</hi>
               </note> Books and Bones, (though <hi>Wickliffe</hi> had been quiet in his Grave above 40 <hi>years</hi> before) cauſing them to be taken up, burned, and their Aſhes to be thrown into the River, ſuch was their rancour of heart; ſince which Times the <hi>Popes</hi> ſucceeding have made it their grand Concern to proſecute the ſame deſign, which is ſtill on foot at this very day, <hi>viz.</hi> to lay Foundations to maintain, and make great the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> by depriving men of <hi>knowledge, which is abſolutely neceſſary to defend themſelves from Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, and Deluſions,</hi> with which the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> is full fraught. And therefore <hi>Paul 4th.</hi> cauſed an <hi>Index</hi> to be compoſed, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Anno</hi> 1659. was ſo ſevere and ſtrict, that there ſcarcely remained a Book to be read, if rightly obſerved; for that therein many Authors and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50679:131"/>Books were condemned, which for 1, 2, or 300 <hi>years</hi> had uſually been read by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> with the privity and without the Contradiction of the <hi>Popes</hi> then ruling; and amongſt the Modern, ſome of thoſe which were Printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, with approbation of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and allowed alſo by the <hi>Brief</hi> of the <hi>Pope himſelf,</hi> are forbidden, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which <hi>Leo 10th.</hi> having read, approved by his <hi>Brief,</hi> dated the <hi>tenth</hi> day of <hi>September,</hi> One thouſand five hundred and eighteen.</p>
            <p>But which is moſt conſiderable as to the main of my intent and purpoſe is to ſhew, that where the <hi>Hogen Mogen Pontiff</hi> (not unlike the chief <hi>Muſty</hi>) doth domineer, there the very bowels of orthodox and ſound Books, (<hi>wherein the Authority of Kings and Civil Magistrates is defended</hi> from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> of the Clergy, and in which the Hypocriſies and Tyrannies of the <hi>Clergie</hi> are manifeſted) are helliſhly raked into, purged, prohibited, and condemned with ſtrange Cruelties; and which is yet more abominable, this is done under the <hi>colour of Faith and Religion,</hi> by which the people under that very pretence of Religion, are miſerably cheated and deluded. A greater myſtery of Iniquity was never broached, then to <hi>uſe Religion ſo dirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as under pretence thereof, to make men, as much as in them lyes, inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nay brutiſh, by keeping them from the knowledge, and conſequently from the <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>truth.</hi> What is this leſs then <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and like men <hi>abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate,</hi> and to ſit as <hi>God in the Temple of God,</hi> (as <hi>Judex vivorum &amp; mortuorum</hi>) working <hi>after the working of Satan with all power and deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath aſſumed to it ſelf to prohibit Books, whether they concerned <hi>Religion</hi> or other Matters, yet before theſe latter years they have not been ſo impudent as to dare to ſay, that the <hi>Prince</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath not power to forbid Books. <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> was the <hi>first</hi> that ſpake that boldly, but was not ſeconded by any a long time after; but he in the beginning of the year 1605. printing the <hi>11th.</hi> Tome of his <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Annals,</hi> libelled therein the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> with much bitterneſs, and againſt many <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and eſpecially againſt <hi>King Ferdinand</hi> the <hi>Catholick,</hi> and the Progenitors of the Fathers ſide of him who then reigned; which Book coming to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millan,</hi> were prohibited by the King's Officers; whereof the Cardinal having notice, made a bitter Invective againſt thoſe Officers unto the <hi>Colledge of Cardinals,</hi> aſſembled in the <hi>vacancy</hi> of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> for that in ſo doing they had forſooth laid hands on Eccleſiaſtical Authority. And afterwards when <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> was choſen <hi>Pope,</hi> he wrote unto the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> the ſame year, wherein amongſt other things he concluded, that to the <hi>Pope only</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the approving of Books of all kinds, much more Eccleſiaſtical ones. Notwithſtanding the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſo wiſe as to abett and continue the Prohibition of his Officers; at which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was ſo netled, that he could not contain himſelf; but printing his <hi>12th. Tome,</hi> 1607. he inſerted a Diſcourſe, ſtigmatizing that Prohibition as abominable and impious, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that Princes do it, becauſe the Books <hi>rebuke their unjuſt acts,</hi> and that it was to take out of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s <hi>hands,</hi> and putting into the <hi>Prince</hi>'s, one of the Keys given him by <hi>Christ, viz.</hi> the Key of knowledge, to diſcern good Cuſtoms from bad. But the <hi>King of Spain</hi> (maugre his virulent Tongue and Pen) was ſo far from recalling the ſaid Prohibition of his Miniſters, that after long patience, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1610. he publiſhed an <hi>Edict</hi> in Print all the World over, wherein he condemned and forbade the Book in ſuch grave and apt terms, that he gave <hi>Baronius</hi> a <hi>Rowland</hi> for his <hi>Oliver.</hi> Could there

               </hi> if their Copy-hold of <hi>Eccleſiastical Juriſdiction</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiastical Liberty</hi> be but touched? It hath been long ſince obſerved by the judicious and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Servite Padre Paulo,</hi> to be plain by all Hiſtories, that Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and Liberty hath occaſioned all the Diſputes and Differences which have happened between his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> in theſe latter Ages.</p>
            <p>Thus far only to ſhew how, when, by whom, and wherefore this politick piece of prudence of guarding the Preſs hath been invented and practiſed. And farther to ſhew, that <hi>Baronius</hi> chargeth the like Uſurpation on tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Majeſty for ends that are not good, when in truth the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Minorite Priests</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> are much more guilty of that crime, denying it to temporal Princes, that they themſelves only may rule uncontroulably from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> from one end of the Earth to the other. <hi>Divine Truths</hi> and <hi>right Reaſon</hi> are more univerſal, and of more force and vertue then all the Councils that ever were, or ever will be, and ought more to be had in reverence and eſteem, and ought to be obeyed, from what point of the Compaſs ſoever they come, or from what Pen ſoever they flow, and ought to have no reſtraint or prohibition put upon them, which would give them check at leaſt, if not check-mate. For that ſuch Prohibition would diſcourage Learning, and hinder Diſcoveries, and put a damp upon ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inquiſitive Brains and Abilities, and impeach that natural Right and Liberty, which belongs to every Individual. And thus to ſtifle and mortifie Reaſon and Truths is the worſt of all Murders; for that by ſuch Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many Truths may be loſt, which may be an irrecoverable loſs not unto particular perſons only, but to whole Nations and Kingdoms; for if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be printed but by the leave of ſome grand <hi>Dominican Inquiſitor</hi> or chief <hi>Muſty,</hi> what Truth or Religion can we have other then that in <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Creed</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan Alcoran?</hi> Falſeſt Seducers! God himſelf never created men, nor never gave talents of Reaſon or Judgment, ſubject and captivate unto the Reaſon and Judgment of others, but hath endued and truſted every man with his own proper talent of Reaſon to make his own choice, according to which only he ſhall be judged at the Judgment of the great Day. There would but little work be left for <hi>Priests</hi> and Preaching, if Law, Compulſion, and ſuch Prohibitions ſhould take place, and impoſe Doctrines, which ought to be governed only by demonſtration of Reaſon, and by perſwaſive means. What wiſdom can there be to chooſe or refuſe? or what praiſe or diſpraiſe, reward or puniſhment, can equally be diſtributed by doing, or not doing good or evil, without full knowledge of good and evil, and that left to our own free choice? What more ordinary then to have one Error exploded by another? and for the Fathers themſelves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to confute that for Hereſie or Error, which is the more orthodox Opinion, and for the Popes (whom <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> was often pleaſed in Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to call his <hi>Vicars of Hell</hi>) to diſagree among themſelves, even about this or that Tranſlation of the Bible it ſelf, witneſs that of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> Did not <hi>Arminius</hi> fall into thoſe Opinions now denominated by his Name, by undertaking to confute an <hi>Anonymus</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50679:132"/>written at <hi>Delf?</hi> The Story of Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> and his Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting each other from <hi>Protestant</hi> to <hi>Papist,</hi> and from <hi>Papist</hi> to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> by diſputing to convince each other, is freſh and memorable.</p>
            <p>Again, Are all Licenſers <hi>Apostolical,</hi> endued with the Spirit of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and without <hi>Biaſſes?</hi> Are the Fathers Inquiſitors, and all other Licenſers, more learned, more judicious, more honeſt, or endued with a greater meaſure of the Spirit of Truth and Grace, then all thoſe that write? Is it honeſt, or juſt, to uſe ſubtleties to deprive wiſe men of any Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for greater knowledge, or for ſaving their ſouls, for fear fools and ill men ſhould make ill uſe of what is written or printed? <hi>Veritas non quaerit Angulos; Truth</hi> needs no ſuch Artificers: beſides, it is but a pitiful ſhift to guard one Avenew, and leave others round about unguarded. Why ſhould we walk contrary to the Preſcript of God and Nature, by curtalling the means of knowing and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>Error?</hi> The Ingenuity of <hi>Truth</hi> requires it not; and it is but a ſad piece of prudence to put ſuch an affront upon Learning and learned men, for fear ſome <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould riſe up in judgment againſt ſome that manage Deſigns and Ends that are not good: moreover, it is marvellous difficult to fit a rigorous Law without offence to God, that muſt equally reſpect good and evil, as a Law of this nature and import doth; and nothing doth more eaſily bring a Law into diſ-uſe, then the impoſſibility, or great difficulty in keeping it, and the great rigour in puniſhing the tranſgreſſors, eſpecially when the ſame good end may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by ordaining only things neceſſary, and moderate puniſhments. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf was at firſt a <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Hereſie</hi> both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and yet was ſpread all the World over by Preaching before ever it was written or printed: of ſuch efficacy are <hi>divine Truths,</hi> that firſt or laſt prevail they will; ſo that in truth perhaps there was not much more wiſdom in the firſt Contrivers of this Trick, then was in <hi>Will. Feſſy,</hi> who in ſpite to a Warren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, would ſet open the Warren-Gates, that his Conies might all run away; or rather in that other Tony in the Fable, who thought to impound the Rooks by ſhutting the Park-Gate only. What advantage, I pray, was it to <hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> that they condemned the Doctrines of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Huſſe</hi> their <hi>Books?</hi> Are they not more believed now than then? I do not mean ſuch Doctrines as they falſified and foiſted in, which were none of theirs, as <hi>Deus debet obedire Diabolo,</hi> &amp;c. Or what Advantage got <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> by condemning <hi>Luther</hi> and his Books? Or what Advantage was it to <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> or to his Cauſe, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a <hi>Treatiſe of Gerſon</hi>'s, (that had been printed above 100 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and many other Books by Name then printed, and all other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which <hi>ſhould be made</hi> againſt his Interdict againſt the <hi>Venetians?</hi> O! much many ways. Firſt, It had the Fate of all ſuch diſhonourable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous Practices; Effects contrary to expectation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the moſt underſtanding perſons did from ſuch a practice conclude, that Reaſon could not ſtand, nor be on their ſide, who would not ſuffer the Reaſons on both ſides to be made manifeſt, and come to the <hi>Lydius lapis,</hi> the Teſt of right Reaſon. It was alſo judged marvellous ſtrange, that all Writings which might be made were prohibited, which was to prejudge before they knew or could underſtand, (as if endued with the Spirit of <hi>Pithon</hi> or of Prophecy) they did foreſee that men could write nothing on their ſide, that could abide the touch, or the light; or elſe that they were ſuch Plenipotentiaries, as that they had full Authority to extinguiſh indifferently the good with the evil. Prepoſterous ways! and therefore that wiſe Republick deem'd it more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50679:133"/>for their honour and juſtification, and advantage, not to imitate his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor the Adviſoes of his ſacred Conclave, in that which they reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them; and therefore they permitted to print and read who would, that thereby <hi>appealing unto all the World, all the World might ſee on their part</hi> that nothing was palliated, or diſguiſed, and that they did not diſtruſt the judgment of the Univerſe on what they had done; and this was done like a State full of Gravity, and full of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Full contrary did thoſe <hi>magnificent Cardinals, Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Colonna</hi> act, whilſt they imployed all their Wits and Learning, not only to blot out thoſe Hand-writings that were, and would have made againſt them, but by pitiful Sophiſtry and Querks to raiſe a duſt or miſt in the minds of their Readers by their own Writings, to diſguiſe and obſcure the <hi>Truth,</hi> that it might not be diſcovered, nor ever come clearly to the Teſt; and what honour they atchieved thereby, Hiſtorians are full, and ſuch Fates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attend ſuch pitiful Policies and Practices.</p>
            <p>The truth is, every Government is, or ought to be ſuch, as to be above all little dirty Intrigues; and this is no great one, <hi>Nitimur in vetitum, Books</hi> like <hi>Poma Adami,</hi> the more forbidden, the more deſired; it being ever ſuſpected in ſuch Caſes, that ſome Truths lye therein hidden, which if diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, would fly in the faces of ſuch Opponents, as ſubtlely endeavour to trample them under foot; beſides, ſuch licenſed Books are but the language of the preſent Times, and have their Viciſſitudes and alternate Fates. We have experienced it in our own days and times; when Epiſcopacy was to be pulled up root and branch, then forſooth all Preſſes ought to be open and free; it was the Peoples Birth-right and priviledge, and the dawning of the day of Truth appearing, after the <hi>Sun had gone down upon our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the day had been dark over them</hi> for ſome years paſt. But no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had they unmitred the Prelates, and minced Epiſcopacy as ſmall as Herbs to the Pot, that every Prieſt might be a Prelate in his ſeveral Pariſh, under another title and vizard, but that the old Acts were new broacht, and trumpt up again,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>March</hi> 2. 1642.</note> and the freedom of the Preſs muſt be beleagured with a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, forſooth, of Examinations, and a Commiſſion of twenty, and learning to her old Barnacles again. This device was firſt ſet on foot by <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mystery,</hi> and deſign to ſmother <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that the Contrivers might the more cleverly ſet up the Kingdom of Antichriſt, in <hi>Cimerian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ignorance,</hi> and if it were poſſible to hinder all reformations of their Lives and Doctrines, and to inſinuate and eſtabliſh Falſhood. <hi>Turkiſh policy!</hi> To uphold their <hi>Aleoran,</hi> they prohibit Learning and Printing, worthy of <hi>Romiſh</hi> not <hi>Protestant</hi> Imitation; <hi>Protestants</hi> need it not; <hi>Truth,</hi> (which is their Shield and Buckler) is as ſtrong as the Almighty; <hi>Magna enim veritas &amp; praevalebit:</hi> Who ever knew her put to the worſe? Let <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> enter like fair Combatants and Wreſtlers into the Liſts; confuting by dint of Reaſon is the only <hi>Corniſh Hug</hi> that can lay flat. It is <hi>Error,</hi> not <hi>Truth,</hi> that ſtands in need of ſuch lame Crutches; write that write will, Licenſing or not Licenſing may make Truth more or leſs viſible or diffuſive, but not leſs victorious; <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt. Rectum est Index ſui &amp; obliqui;</hi> the crookedneſs of Error will the more appear, if once brought to the light and true Rule: Why are we then ſo <hi>be-Jeſuited,</hi> ſeeing by locking up the Preſs <hi>Truth</hi> is much more likely to be ſuppreſt then Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Error? The great and uſual Clamour and Out-cry againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Preſs is, that it encourageth <hi>Libellers</hi> againſt Kingdoms, States, and men in Authority. If they characterize and repreſent falſly, it is then a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50679:133"/>Libel, and a Crime to be, and may be puniſhed by the Judges. If <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Dominion, and wrong fully ſpeak evil of Dignities, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tales,</hi> it is a Crime of the ſame nature. But if publication or declaration of Truths ſhall be eſteemed Libels, there's no Law, no Logick, nor yet Divinity for that. Nay, it is derogatory even to the God of Truth; <hi>Go tell Judah of her ſins, and Iſrael of her tranſgreſſion.</hi> If <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>his Fathers houſe trouble Iſrael,</hi> it's no crime for <hi>Elijah to tell him ſo;</hi> nor in <hi>Nathan</hi> to ſay unto <hi>David, Thou art the man.</hi> And the <hi>prophane Prophets of Iſrael must be propheſied against.</hi> All Governments were inſtituted by God for the good of the governed, and it is not Libelling to tell them ſo. Forbidding publication of Books, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> firſt obtained, is to make the Licenſers Judges of all Truths and Opinions; and it's odds that they will let nothing paſs, but what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and fitted to their own Intereſt, and the <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>preſent Times.</hi> And is not this a Crime of the ſame nature with the <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> which all honeſt, wiſe and pious men abhor. It is at beſt but an oblique Art, ſervant only to <hi>Times, Parties</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> deſtructive to Learning and Ingenuity, to ſuppreſs Monuments of Reaſon uſed by their Adverſaries, on whoſe ſide happily <hi>Truth</hi> is. The more noble and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way is to abandon all ſuch little and diſingenuous Tricks and Devices, and labour by all holy means and endeavours to ſuppreſs Vice. To puniſh and diſcountenance ſin and ſinners, is more glorious before God and man, then to padlock Preſſes; it being a ſhrewd ſign that <hi>Truth</hi> is not on their ſide, that ſuppreſs the adverſe Reaſons. <hi>Truth</hi> is able to juſtifie it ſelf, and acquire its own glory and reward of Ingenuity, and Chriſtian Simplicity, when ſuppreſſing or expunging betrays, that we either diſtruſt God for the maintenance of his own Truths, or that we diſtruſt the Cauſe, or our ſelves, or our Abilities. It is one thing to ſtifle Books in the womb, before ever they are permitted to ſee light, or that before they are either known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and that perhaps by one ſingle perſon, who happily may be much leſs learned, honeſt, or orthodox then the Author; and another thing to condemn both Author and Book, when examined, and found faulty and erroneous: For it is moſt juſt and reaſonable, that all and every State ſhould conſider how Books as well as men do behave themſelves, and puniſh or not puniſh accordingly; accordingly one—<hi>Carter</hi> a Printer ſuffered in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days.</p>
            <p>§. Conſider matter of Fact, by looking a little back. Although it was early foretold that <hi>Antichrist</hi> would come, nay that many <hi>Antichrists</hi> were already come, yet until after the <hi>800th.</hi> year, about which time the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> divided from the <hi>Western,</hi> there were not many <hi>Hereticks</hi> found in the Weſtern parts for 300 <hi>years</hi> after. But after the <hi>year</hi> 1100. by reaſon of the continual Jars which for 50 <hi>years</hi> before had been between the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Emperors,</hi> which continued unto the year 1200. with frequent Wars, there did ariſe many <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (as the <hi>Popes</hi> were pleaſed to call them, by as good <hi>Logick</hi> as the <hi>Lion</hi> is fabled to call the Foxes Ears, <hi>Horns</hi>) whoſe moſt common <hi>Hereſies</hi> were againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>uſurped Authorities,</hi> over <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi> This moved the Popes and their Conclaves, for Ends not good, to eſtabliſh the two Religious Orders of <hi>St. Francis</hi> and <hi>St. Dominick,</hi> (pure <hi>Fanaticks</hi>) which were ſoon filled with the moſt zealous and learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that that Age could afford, altogether devoted to the maintaining of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and the Authority of the <hi>Pope;</hi> to which two Orders the care of the Inquiſition newly erected was committed, and what hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50679:134"/>followed ſince is obvious to every intelligent man, which ſoon ſpawned the firſt ſanguinary Law againſt Hereticks, by the help of the <hi>Emperor Frederick the 2d.</hi> 1244. impoſing <hi>fire on Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. But before this we had no Charm nor Lock upon the Preſs; no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for Books; no <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> for their Authors; we had no proper, real and propitiatory Sacrifice in the Maſs for the living and the dead, nor dry or demi-Communions; no <hi>Conventicle</hi> at <hi>Trent;</hi> no new Creed with 12 new Articles either of <hi>Trent</hi> or of <hi>Johannes Baptista Poſa,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> never heard of before, newly printed, newly come forth; no blotting out of the ſecond Commandment; no dividing of the tenth Commandment into two, to amuſe and cheat the People; no Doctrine of Infallibility, nor yet of Probability; no Penance Sacramental; no Satisfaction; no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Confeſſion, as now uſed; no <hi>Hurtado;</hi> no <hi>Filliucius;</hi> no <hi>Bauny;</hi> no <hi>Leſſius;</hi> no <hi>Eſcobar;</hi> no <hi>Jeſuits Morals;</hi> no power to depoſe Kings; no diſſolving Oaths of Allegiance; no Gunpowder-Treaſons, and an Iliad more of ſuch damnable Errors and Hereſies. I conclude therefore that it bears no ſhew, that forbidding men to write tends to any good end, but really to the end to conceal the Truth, and to ſhew it to the World only under a Mask, or ſome deceitful Light.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with this Obſervation concerning Printing it ſelf, That in the days of <hi>Luther,</hi> and Troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> about <hi>Religion</hi> and Vices of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> it was ſuggeſted unto <hi>Clement the 7th.</hi> that the occaſion of them all was from the <hi>new Invention of Printing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>By</hi> Fauſt <hi>and</hi> Guttenburg.</note> ſcarce 80 <hi>years</hi> found out, and now not poſſible to be ſuppreſſed; which though it had brought to light many Books and much Learning, yet they found that in this ſhort time it had made a great diſcovery of their <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> their jugling Arts and Legerdemains, much to their prejudice, (which whilſt the <hi>Laity</hi> were kept ignorant of, all went for currant on their ſide) and imputed thereto all the Troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> about thoſe <hi>Centum gravamina,</hi> then complained of; for that now men being better enlightned by <hi>printed Books,</hi> began to call in queſtion the preſent Faith, and Tenets of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to examine how far Religion was departed from its <hi>primitive Institution and Purity.</hi> Among which one great Crime was, that the <hi>Laity</hi> and vulgar ſort of men were taught and exhorted to <hi>read the Scriptures,</hi> and pray every one in their own native Language: A great Crime, I confeſs, and much to be dreaded; for if this were permitted to paſs for currant Doctrine, the Vulgar would quickly diſcover their Cheats and Uſurpations, and believe that the <hi>Clergie</hi> had abuſed and <hi>cheated</hi> them hitherto. For if men were once perſwaded, that they could make their own way and court to God by their <hi>own prayers and addreſſes</hi> in their own Tongues, which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that they would be heard, and be more prevalent in Heaven, than mumbled in <hi>Latin,</hi> without underſtanding what they prayed for, it would certainly bring Contempt on the <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Maſs-Priests,</hi> on <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Pardon-mongers,</hi> on <hi>auricular Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and on the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and in ſum would impeach all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, which (by <hi>ſinister Artifices</hi>) had been got and kept ſecret by the <hi>Clergie</hi> for many generations.</p>
            <p>For without all doubt, the keeping of theſe and the like Myſteries, (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iniquity than) of Religion, wickedly obtained, and as wickedly kept in the hands of Prieſts only, (<hi>participes Criminis,</hi> parties to their Cheats) have given that eſteem the Prieſts now have amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> through many Ages to this very day.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50679:134"/>
            <p>Now ſince Printing hath made ſuch Diſcoveries of ſuch Myſteries of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and brought to light the more pure Word and Doctrine, ſo that their Traditions, their Indulgences, their falſe Gloſſes, and their other like Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, could not prevail as formerly, <hi>Romiſh Craft</hi> ſought out other peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inventions to maintain their Impieties, whereof <hi>padlocking the Preſs</hi> was not the leaſt, to keep the Laity ignorant. And though they could not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſs Printing, yet in <hi>Romiſh</hi> Territories they ordained, that no Book ſhould be printed without an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> firſt obtained from ſome <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> or ſome ſuch like <hi>Myrmidon,</hi> digging deep to hide their Counſels from all the Laity, and to ſtifle any Light or Truth, that was not ſuitable to their deeds of Darkneſs; hence hath proceeded the obſtructions of many Truths fit to be made common, but have not been able to appear in the light but by ſtealth: Inſtead thereof they now ſet up <hi>heathen Philoſophy and Metaphyſicks</hi> againſt <hi>Scripture,</hi> to make good their myſterious Juglings, diſputing and reaſoning more out of them than out of holy Writ. Thus they ſet up Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (or rather quirks of Learning) againſt Learning, and old muſty Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of former Times, and ſuch obſcure paſſages as needed their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Explanations, and all to keep the <hi>Laity</hi> in ſuſpence between fear and controverſal Juglings and Equivocations: Nay, they rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Tropes and Allegories, (where none are needful) if not to <hi>Cabala</hi> it ſelf than allow that all the parts of Religious Worſhip, (tho' never ſo clear and plain to every Underſtanding, as to fall eaſily within common Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings) ſhould be without their Explications or Expoſitions; ſo that they cannot monopolize the Myſteries of their Church-Government ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wholly within their Eccleſiaſtick Circle, but diſcoveries are made of their <hi>Cheats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things well weighed and conſidered, the Concluſion is natural, that it bears no ſhew, that forbidding men to write tends to any good end, but really to the end to conceal the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to ſhew it to the World in <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carata,</hi> or ſome deceitful Light only.</p>
